Our results demonstrated that hsa-miR-483-5p, hsa-miR-675, hsa-miR-139-3p, hsa-miR-598, hsa-miR-625 and hsa-miR-187 could serve as prognostic and predictive markers for survival of BDC patients and could potentially be provided as targets for future therapy.
Targeting the centromeres of chromosomes 3, 7, 17 (CEP3, 7, 17) and the 9p21-locus (LSI9p21) for diagnosing bladder cancer (BC) is time- and cost-intensive and requires a manual investigation of the sample by a well-trained investigator thus overall limiting its use in clinical diagnostics and large-scaled epidemiological studies.
Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) causing compressive cervical myelopathy or radiculopathy is rare.
However, thoracic OLF rarely causes radiculopathy.
We report a rare case of thoracic radiculopathy caused by OLF.
Thoracic radiculopathy caused by OLF was suspected.
Thoracic OLF rarely causes radiculopathy, but it should be considered as a differential diagnosis of thoracic radicular pain.
OLF should be kept in mind if a patient presents with radiculopathy, particularly in the cervical region, for which surgical intervention is contemplated.
Radiculopathy resulting from ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is extremely rare and concerns only intercostal neuralgias.
We describe a 37-year-old Caucasian woman with a lumbar radiculopathy revealing an OLF.
Pancreatitis was induced in C57Bl/6 wild-type (control), cathepsin B-knockout, and cathepsin L-knockout mice by partial pancreatic duct ligation with supramaximal caerulein injection, or by repetitive supramaximal caerulein injections alone.
Trypsinogen became activated in macrophages cultured with purified trypsinogen or co-cultured with pancreatic acini and in pancreata of mice with pancreatitis; trypsinogen activation required macrophage endocytosis and expression and activity of cathepsin B, and was sensitive to pH.
Activation of trypsinogen in macrophages resulted in translocation of NF-kB and production of inflammatory cytokines; mice without trypsinogen activation (cathepsin B-knockout mice) in macrophages developed less severe pancreatitis compared with control mice.
Transfer of macrophage from control mice to cathepsin B-knockout mice increased the severity of pancreatitis.
Experimental studies in acute pancreatitis (AP) suggest a strong association of acinar cell injury with cathepsin B-dependent intracellular activation of trypsin.
Pancreas, lung, and serum was harvested up to 48 h after pancreatitis induction and used for histopathology, amylase, lipase, cathepsin B, trypsin, and elastase activity measurements, myeloperoxidase (MPO) content and cytokine concentrations.
In taurocholate-pancreatitis AZD8309 reduced cathepsin B activity and MPO.
The lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin B (CTSB) is a known activator of trypsinogen, and its deletion reduces disease severity in experimental pancreatitis.
In summary, CTSB in pancreatitis undergoes activation in a secretory, vesicular, and acidic compartment where it activates trypsinogen.
C3F was also significantly increased in 20 chronic renal failure (CRF) patients as compared to 196 controls; this would support the existence of functional differences between C3F and C3S alleles.
Ectopic expression of Fgfr2c, a gene implicated in craniosynostosis in mice and humans, and that of Runx2 was detected within the affected sutures of Bcl11b(-/-) mice.
These data suggest that ectopic expression of Fgfr2c in the sutural mesenchyme, without concomitant changes in the expression of FGF ligands, appears to induce the RUNX2-dependent osteogenic program and craniosynostosis in Bcl11b(-/-) mice.
(2) An analysis of all published HLA data for patients of European origin indicated a weak association of pernicious anemia with HLA-B7.
Specifically, studies have demonstrated miR-221/-222 function as oncogenes, and promote PCa cell proliferation and the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
SOCS3 was found significantly declined, while microRNA-221 (miR-221) obviously up-regulated in bladder cancer tissue.
This study investigated the role of miR-221 in regulating SOCS3/JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway and bladder cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.
Bladder cancer tumor tissue and para-carcinoma tissue were collected from patients to test miR-221 and SOCS3 expressions.
MiR-221 significantly increased, while SOCS3 obviously reduced in bladder cancer tissue compared with para-carcinoma tissue.
MiR-221 elevated, while SOCS3 reduced in bladder cancer tissue.
As miR-221 targets several regulators of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and a link between this pathway and CD44 has been previously shown in prostate cancer, we considered miR-221 regulation of CD44 may be through this pathway.
The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene status, tumor tissue prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), miR-23b, miR-26a and miR-221 expression levels in combination with preoperative serum PSA level to the risk of PCa recurrence after radical prostatectomy.
Only 5 genes were significantly up-regulated in MS patients vs control subjects; namely TNF-AIP6, IL-1RA, OASL, CLC and DOCK4 (p &lt; 0.05).
Analysis of the effector molecules of the up-regulated genes revealed that 83 MS patients had positive serum level of OASL, 87 MS patients had positive serum levels of IL-1RA, and none of the 88 MS patients showed detectable serum levels of TNF-AIP6, CLC or DOCK4.
OASL and IL-1RA genes were strongly expressed in MS patients and that their effector molecules may be considered as biomarkers associated with the inflammatory process of the disease and possibly treatment response.
However, IRF1, IFNK and viral restriction factors (IFIT1, 2, 3, 5, OASL, CD74, RTP4) were up-regulated.
The signature's genes are: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Interleukin 16 (IL16), 2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (OASL), and Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor E5 (ADGRE5).
Previous work has identified that following viral infection, type I IFN signaling induces the production of the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family, which include OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OAS-like (OASL) protein.
OASL was identified to be strongly induced following viral infection through engaging the RNA sensor RIG-I and increasing signaling through this pathway to enhance the anti-viral type I IFN response.
Surprisingly, infection with viral dsDNA revealed an IFN inhibitory role and therefore pro-viral function of OASL through the inhibition of the cGAS cytosolic DNA sensing mechanism.
Intracellular bacteria are able to activate the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, however the role of OASL during bacterial infection is largely unknown.
Vacuolar pathogenic microbes such as mycobacteria induce OASL early post infection, where it functions in a prosurvival fashion by inhibiting autophagic mechanisms and antimicrobial peptide expression.
This suggests an underestimated role of OASL in the innate immune response to infection with a variety of pathogens and points to OASL-associated modulation of the type I IFN response.
OASL may therefore play a critical role in defining the outcome of infection.
We earlier nominated 16 genes (IRF7, IFIT1, IFIT5, OASL, CLC, GBP-1, PSMB9, HERC5, CCR1, CD36, MS4A4A, BIRC4BP, PLSCR1, DEFA1/DEFA3, DEFA4, and COL9A2) as predictors of response to remission induction therapy against MPA.
The 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) is an interferon (IFN)-induced protein that plays an important role in the antiviral action of IFN, with OAS3 being one of the four OAS classes (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, OASL).
In a pooled analysis of 105 candidate genes and two genome-wide association studies, we observed associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms from nine genes (EIF2AK2, IFNAR2, ITPA, MBL2, MX1, OASL, SPP1, TGFB1, TNK2) with response to interferon-based therapy.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the OAS1 (rs1131476), OAS2 (rs1293747), OAS3 (rs2072136), OASL (rs10849829) and IL28B (rs12979860, rs12980275 and rs8099917) genes were studied to examine their associations with responses to IFN treatment in paediatric patients.
The association analysis for CR showed that the TT genotype of IL28B rs12979860 was present only in the no-CR group (P = 0.033) and the AA genotype of OASL rs10849829 was significantly more frequent in the no-CR group (P = 0.044, OR = 0.26, 95%CI: 0.07-0.88).
The aim of the present study was to evaluate agreement between three pairs formed by one of three mania scales (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS], Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Scale [BRMS], or the Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania [CARS-M]) and a single depression scale (21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [21-HAM-D]) for evaluation of response to mood stabilizers in patients with mixed bipolar disorder.
The present study suggests that any one of the three tested mania rating scales (YMRS, BRMS, and CARS-M) can be combined with the 21-HAM-D to assess treatment response in patients with mixed bipolar disorder.
Older adults and patients with dementia often have disrupted circadian activity rhythms (CARs).
Clinically, decreased levels of cGAS are associated with poor prognosis for patients with breast cancer harbouring high levels of miR-25/93.
In our analysis, we found that increased expression of 12 mature miRNAs-hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-361-5p, hsa-miR-103a-3p, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-374b-5p, hsa-miR-140-3p, hsa-miR-25-3p, hsa-miR-651-5p, hsa-miR-200c-3p, hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-miR-30c-5p, and hsa-let-7i-5p -each predicted improved breast cancer survival.
Here, we report a novel function of isoliquiritigenin (ISL) as a natural inhibitor of autophagy-related miR-25 in killing drug-resistant breast cancer cells.
Overall, our results not only indicate that ISL acts as a natural autophagy inducer to increase breast cancer chemosensitivity, but also reveal that miR-25 functions as a novel regulator of autophagy by targeting ULK1.
Expression of a panel of seven microRNAs (hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-16, hsa-miR-17, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-221, hsa-miR-326, and hsa-miR-375) and seven target genes ( E2F3, PI3KCA, TOM34, WNT5A, PDCD4, DFFA, and EGFR) in 43 glioblastoma multiforme specimens were profiled compared to non-cancer tissues via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
The present study examined whether it could be possible to quantify the expression of TOMM34 and RNF43 in colorectal cancer and liver metastasis samples prepared from paraffin blocks.
Quantification of TOMM34 and RNF43 gene expression in several-year-old paraffin-embedded colorectal cancer specimens was possible by qPCR using the Universal ProbeLibrary.
The mRNA levels of seven TAAs, Wilms' tumor gene (WT1), kinetochore associated-2 (KNTC2), cell division cycle associated-1 (CDCA1), M phase phosphoprotein-1 (MPHOSPH1), DEP domain-containing 1 (DEPDC1), 34-kDa translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM34) and ring finger protein-43 (RNF43), were analyzed using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and their relationships with clinicopathological factors and the cell cycle were analyzed.
These antigenic peptides were derived from 5 proteins identified as cancer-testis antigens(ring finger protein 43 [RNF43], translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 34[TOMM34], maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase[MELK], forkhead box M1[FOXM1], and holliday junction recognition protein[HJURP])and 2 vascular endothelial growth factor receptors(VEGFR1 and VEGFR2).
To evaluate the safety of combination vaccine treatment of multiple peptides, phase I clinical trial was conducted for patients with advanced colorectal cancer using five novel HLA-A*2402-restricted peptides, three peptides derived from oncoantigens, ring finger protein 43 (RNF43), 34 kDa-translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM34), and insulin-like growth factor-II mRNA binding protein 3 (KOC1), and the remaining two from angiogenesis factors, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2.
These antigenic peptides were derived from 2 different cancer-testis antigens, ring finger protein 43 (RNF43) and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 34( TOMM34).
We conducted a clinical trial of colorectal cancer-specific peptide( RNF43, TOMM34) vaccines with uracil/tegafur( UFT)+Leucovorin( LV) for the treatment of advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer.
We started a clinical trial of vaccines against multiple peptides (RNF43, TOMM34, forkhead box protein M1 [FOXM1], maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase [MELK], holliday junction recognition protein[HJURP], vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1[VEGFR1], and VEGFR2) for the treatment of advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer.
Recently, analysis of tumor antigens using micro-arrays has revealed upregulation             of cancer-testis antigens RNF43 and TOMM34 and vascular endothelial growth factor             receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in colorectal cancer.
Our aim was to analyze the dynamic modulation, determined by ADT, of the expression of selected genes involved in the pathogenesis and progression of prostate cancer (TMPRSS2:ERG, WNT11, SPINK1, CHGA, AR, and SPDEF) using real-time polymerase chain reaction in a series of 59 surgical samples of prostate carcinomas, including 37 cases preoperatively treated with ADT and 22 untreated cases, and in 43 corresponding biopsies.
However, Wnt-11 expression in cervical cancer has not been well investigated.
Wnt-11 and HR-HPV E6 expression increased in a manner that corresponded with the progression of cervical cancer and was significantly correlated with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics cancer stage, lymph node metastasis, tumor size, and HPV infection.
Wnt-11 protein expression was positively associated with HR-HPV E6 protein expression in all 78 cervical cancer samples (P &lt; 0.001).
Furthermore, Wnt-11 was positively associated with P-JNK1 expression and promoted cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion.
These observations suggest that the increased Wnt-11 expression observed in cervical cancer cells may lead to the phosphorylation and activation of JNK-1 and significantly promote tumor cell proliferation and cell migration/invasion through activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway.
Consequently, Wnt-11 may serve as a novel target for cervical cancer therapy.
In this study, we aimed to explore the association among gene variants of five cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Alfa), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-Beta1), interferon gamma (IFN-Gamma), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10), and clinical parameters and prognosis in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) treated with novel therapeutic drugs in Turkish population for the first time except TNF-Alfa.
Using absolute value of log2 fold-change &gt; 2 or extremely small P value (10-20) as a criterion, we identified nine significant genes (HBA1, HBB, HIST1H2AC, GSTT1, MYL7, NPPA, NPPB, PDK4, PLA2G2A) in LVH, also found in published data set for ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy in heart failure.
Tolerized cow's milk protein (CMP)-sensitive atopic dermatitis had, in particular, decreased kappa-casein-specific IgG(1) levels, compared with clinically reactive patients.
Tolerised patients, particularly those with atopic dermatitis, had decreased responses to kappa-casein which were restored after Treg depletion.
A markedly decreased proliferative response to kappa-casein in tolerised IgE-mediated CMA patients with atopic dermatitis, which was abrogated by Treg depletion, suggested a role for kappa-casein in tolerance induction.
In order to investigate the role of food antigen-specific T cells circulating in the blood of patients with food allergy, we compared T cell response to three casein components (alpha s-, beta- and, kappa-casein) with specificities of IgG and IgE binding to the casein components in four milk-allergic patients (P1-4) with atopic dermatitis.
Studies have identified that PKM2 is related to the development of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in rodents and humans.
Mechanistically, we showed that hyperglycemia and diabetes decreased PKM2 tetramer formation and activity by sulfenylation in mouse glomeruli and cultured podocytes.
Podocyte-specific Pkm2-knockout (KO) mice with diabetes developed worse albuminuria and glomerular pathology.
Conversely, we found that pharmacological activation of PKM2 by a small-molecule PKM2 activator, TEPP-46, reversed hyperglycemia-induced elevation in toxic glucose metabolites and mitochondrial dysfunction, partially by increasing glycolytic flux and PGC-1Alfa mRNA in cultured podocytes.
To identify the miR-155 targets relevant for B-cell lymphoma, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation of Argonaute 2 in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cells upon miR-155 inhibition and in BL cells upon ectopic expression of miR-155.
Further research suggested that METTL13 negatively regulates cell proliferation in bladder cancer and reinstates G1/S checkpoint via the coordinated downregulation of CDK6, CDK4 and CCND1, decreased phosphorylation of Rb and subsequent delayed cell cycle progression.
miR-29c could inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells via regulating CDK6.
p34cdc2, collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4), doublecortin (DCX), HuD, and NeuN expression was assessed in tuber (n = 16) and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA; n = 6) specimens in tuberous sclerosis complex to define the developmental phenotype and lineage of giant cells (CGs) in these lesions.
First, logistic regression analysis in two human prostate gene expression datasets revealed that expression levels of five genes (CXCL14, ITGAX, LPCAT2, RNASEH2A, and ZNF322) were positively correlated with aggressive prostate cancer and two genes (CCL19 and HIST1H1A) were protective for aggressive prostate cancer.
Second generation H1 antihistamines (H1A) are currently recommended as first choice medications for allergic rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis.
Consecutive patients suffering from allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis were included and followed prospectively for 30 days from the prescription of a second generation H1A in monotherapy.
Antibody 3.1 potently neutralizes influenza viruses from the H1a clade (i.e., H1, H2, H5, H6) but has little neutralizing activity against the H1b clade.
We have overexpressed OTX2 in retinal pigmented epithelial cells before their transplantation in the eye of a model of retinitis pigmentosa carrying a mutation in Mertk, a gene specifically expressed by retinal pigmented epithelial cells.
Transplantation of OTX2-genetically modified cells may be medically effective for other retinal diseases involving the retinal pigmented epithelium as age-related macular degeneration.
Therapeutic restoration of OTX2 expression might help revive RPE and visual function in retinal diseases such as AMD.
The retinal disease resembles conditional mice models that show slow photoreceptor degeneration secondary to loss of Otx2 function in the adult RPE.
When the beads were coated with amelogenin gene splice products (A+4 or A-4), the expression of osteo-chondrogenic markers (RP59, Sox9, or BSP) was also observed.
This study has provided evidence that the regulation of the SVCT2 transporter plays an important role not only in T1D osteoporosis but also in other oxidative stress-related musculoskeletal complications.
Autosomal recessive HMG-CoA synthase deficiency (HMGCS2D) is characterized by hypoketotic hypoglycemia, vomiting, lethargy, and hepatomegaly after periods of prolonged fasting or illness.
Most frequent disease presentation in our patients was characterized with early and prominent oromandibular dystonia (OMD), followed by severe generalized dystonia and early loss of mobility within the first five years of prolonged disease duration (18.7 +/- 10.0 years).
Eight out of 9 patients reached 7 significant clinical milestones (OMD, generalized dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, postural instability, gait difficulties, ADL dependency) in the first 4.6 years of disease course.
A smoothelin-deficient mouse model may help to establish the role of smoothelin-A in intestinal contraction and provide a model for myogenic chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.
The pathology of mice lacking smoothelin-A is reminiscent of that seen in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.
Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is characterized by severe progressive liver disease and renal tubular dysfunction.
If left untreated this deficiency of functional FAH leads to a buildup of toxic metabolites that can cause liver disease, kidney dysfunction and high mortality.
In this study, we investigated whether fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase deficient (FAH-/-) pigs, a novel large-animal model of HT1, develop fibrosis and cirrhosis characteristic of the human disease.
Under conditions of low-dose NTBC, FAH-/- pigs developed liver fibrosis and portal hypertension, and thus may serve as a large-animal model of chronic liver disease.
Fah-deficient mice and pigs are phenotypically analogous to human HT1, but do not recapitulate all the chronic features of the human disorder, especially liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.
More importantly, the Fah(-/-) rats developed remarkable liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, which have not been observed in Fah mutant mice or pigs.
Moreover, the highly efficient repopulation of hepatocytes in Fah(-/-) livers prevented the progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and in turn restored liver architecture.
These results indicate that Fah(-/-) rats may be used as an animal model of HT1 with liver cirrhosis.
Recent GWAS completed for three types of common adult-onset glaucoma have identified novel loci for POAG (primary-open-angle glaucoma) (ABCA1, AFAP1, GMDS, PMM2, TGFBR3, FNDC3B, ARHGEF12, GAS7, FOXC1, ATXN2, TXNRD2); PACG (primary angle-closure glaucoma (EPDR1, CHAT, GLIS3, FERMT2, DPM2-FAM102); and exfoliation syndrome (XFS) glaucoma (CACNA1A).
Recently, a genome-wide association study identified genetic variations in ITGA4 and HLA-DRB1 that affect the LMR levels and were widely believed to be susceptibility genes for autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
To evaluate serum levels of fractalkine (FKN), a mediator of leukocyte transmigration, C-reactive protein (CRP) and expression of integrins CD11a and CD49d on peripheral blood lymphocytes in systemic sclerosis (SSc) and to investigate whether they are modulated by intravenous prostaglandin E1 (PGE1).
Prostaglandin E1 down-regulates serum fractalkine level, as well as CD11a and CD49d expression on peripheral blood lymphocytes, which suggests additional mechanisms in which this vasodilatatory agent exerts its efficacy in systemic sclerosis.
MR-1S directly phosphorylates and activates the MEK-ERK-RSK pathway to accelerate cancer growth and facilitates metastasis by activating the MLC2-FAK-AKT pathway.
After overexpressing TMEM17, levels of p-ERK and its downstream molecules, p-P90RSK and Snail, were down-regulated, while levels of Occludin and Zo-1 were up-regulated, which result in the inhibition of invasion and migration ability of lung cancer cells.
Herein, to understand the underlying relationship between obesity and brain tumors, we investigated the effect of leptin, alone or in combination with sPLA2-IIA on astrocytoma cell functions.
PLA2g2a was elevated with hypothyroidism and high fat diets which may contribute to the low grade inflammation associated with hypothyroidism and diet induced obesity.
There were significant correlations between age, visceral obesity, MPO, sPLA2, and SAA (r = 0.43; p = 0.00; r = 0.30; p = 0.00; r = 0.28; p = 0.00 and r = 0.53; p = 0.00).
We suggest that pla2g2a may have a causal relationship with chronic adiposity and metabolic syndrome and that its inhibition in vivo may be a valuable new approach to treat obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic dysfunction in humans.
Trypanosoma brucei, protozoan parasites that cause human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), depend on ornithine uptake and metabolism by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) for survival.
Furthermore, the molecular dynamics simulation work reveals that ZINC67909154 could be a potent inhibitor and this compound can be used to combat VL disease Conclusion: This study concludes that ZINC67909154 has the great potential to inhibit L. donovani ODC and would add to the drug discovery process against visceral leishmaniasis.
arginase (ARG), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), spermidine synthase (SpdS), trypanothione synthetase (TryS or TSA), trypanothione reductase (TryR or TR), tryparedoxin peroxidase (TXNPx), deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) are promising targets for the development of new drugs against leishmaniasis.
The plasma levels of arginase I, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), transforming growth factor Beta (TGF-Beta), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were higher in patients with DCL, compared with patients with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL) or with controls from an area of endemicity.
Immunohistochemistry confirmed that arginase I, ODC, and cyclooxygenase2 expression was higher in lesion biopsy specimens from patients with DCL than in those from patients with LCL.
Our data implicate arginase I, ODC, PGE2, and TGF-Beta in the failure to mount an efficient immune response and suggest perspectives in the development of new strategies for therapeutic intervention for patients with DCL.
The active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal 5-phosphate, is, besides its antioxidative properties, a cofactor for a variety of essential enzymes present in the malaria parasite which includes the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, synthesis of polyamines), the aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT, involved in the protein biosynthesis), and the serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT, a key enzyme within the folate metabolism).
Alfa-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a potent drug used for the treatment of African sleeping sickness is an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the first rate limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis.
This is the first study from north India reporting CYP1B1 mutations in Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome with bilateral buphthalmos and early onset glaucoma.
Purported BS2 cases may be divided into: (1) Bardet-Biedl syndrome with fortuitous coloboma or aniridia, (2) BS2 sensu stricto, a recessively inherited syndrome of sexual infantilism, short stature, coloboma, and preaxial polydactyly without obesity, only known from the original report, (3) a "new" dominantly inherited form of colobomatous microphthalmia occasionally associated with obesity, hypogonadism, and mental retardation, to which our observations belong.
Ganglioneuromas (GNs) are benign tumors resulting from neural crest tissue.
Adrenal ganglioneuromas (GNs) constitute rare, differentiated tumors which originate from neural crest cells.
Ganglioneuromas (GNs) are hamartomatous tumors derived from the autonomic nervous system.
GNs are categorized into three different morphological subtypes, namely, polypoid GN, ganglioneuromatous polyposis, and diffuse ganglioneuromatosis.
Ganglioneuromas (GNs) arising from neural crest sympathogonia are rare benign neurogenic tumors.
Ganglioneuromas (GNs) are neural crest cell-derived tumors and rarely occur in the adrenal gland.
Ganglioneuromas (GNs) are the rarest and most benign of the neuroblastic tumors.
Ganglioneuromas (GNs) are rare benign tumors and their association with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is especially uncommon.
Four of eight T1D-specific regions contained known type 2 diabetes (T2D) candidate genes (COBL, GLIS3, RNLS and BCAR1), suggesting a shared cellular etiology.
Autoantibodies to insulin (IAA), GAD (GADA), insulinoma-associated antigen-2 (IA-2A) and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A) were measured in follow-up sera, and genotyping for type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes (HLA-DR/HLA-DQ, INS variable number of tandem repeats [VNTR] and single nucleotide polymorphisms at PTPN22, PTPN2, ERBB3, IL2, SH2B3, CTLA4, IFIH1, KIAA0350 [also known as CLEC16A], CD25, IL18RAP, IL10, COBL) was performed on the DNA samples of children born to a parent with type 1 diabetes and prospectively followed from birth for up to 22 years.
Children of parents with type 1 diabetes and prospectively followed from birth for the development of islet autoantibodies and diabetes were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms at 12 type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes (ERBB3, PTPN2, IFIH1, PTPN22, KIAA0350, CD25, CTLA4, SH2B3, IL2, IL18RAP, IL10 and COBL).
The greatest diabetes discrimination was obtained by the sum of risk alleles for eight genes (IFIH1, CTLA4, PTPN22, IL18RAP, SH2B3, KIAA0350, COBL and ERBB3) in the HLA-risk children.
However, all of the eosinophil-activating cytokines, such as IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF, are typically present in atopic diseases, including allergic asthma.
In a murine model of allergic asthma, we found that Tyk-2((-/-)) asthmatic mice have induced peribronchial collagen deposition, mucosal type mast cells in the lung, IRF4 and hyperproliferative lung Th2 CD4(+) effector T cells over-expressing IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13.
Heterologous or homologous Nrf2 deletion (Nrf2+/- or Nrf2-/-) rescued the pancreatic phenotypes, weight loss and hypoglycemia in KC::Keap1 mice, suggesting that Nrf2 is a major downstream target of Keap1.
Disrupting the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway enhances Nrf2 activity, which has been identified as an important approach for the prevention of different chronic diseases in which oxidative stress and inflammation are present, such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
This study investigates the role of ACSVL3 in the maintenance of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) stem cell self-renewal and the capacity of GBM stem cells to initiate tumor xenograft formation.
We examined ACSVL3 expression during differentiation of several GBM stem cell enriched neurosphere cultures.
ACSVL3 expression levels were substantially increased in GBM stem cell enriched neurosphere cultures and decreased after differentiation of the neurospheres.
Furthermore, ACSVL3 knockdown reduced anchorage-independent neurosphere cell growth, neurosphere-forming capacity as well as self-renewal of these GBM stem cell enriched neurosphere cultures.
A link between ACSVL3 and cancer stem cell phenotype was further established by the findings that ACSVL3 expression was regulated by receptor tyrosine kinase pathways that support GBM stem cell self-renewal and tumor initiation, including EGFR and HGF/c-Met pathways.
Our findings indicate that the lipid metabolism enzyme ACSVL3 is involved in GBM stem cell maintenance and the tumor-initiating capacity of GBM stem cell enriched-neurospheres in animals.
A significant association was detected between TLR9 genotypes and some of the disease manifestations as myositis (p = 0.032), psychosis (p = 0.014), photosensitivity (p = 0.002), and pleurisy (p = &lt;0.001).
In addition, rLj-HMGB2 could induce the generation of proinflammatory mediators in the activated human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP1), which suggested that Lj-HMGB2 may participate in the immune response of the lampreys.
Nut consumption was independently associated with a decreased risk of overall and vascular-disease mortality, particularly in women.
Nut consumption has been inconsistently associated with risk of stroke.
Ulcerative colitis patients display increased numbers of circulating pro-inflammatory monocyte human leukocyte antigen-DR [HLA-DRhi] monocytes expressing high levels of the gut-homing C-C chemokine receptor 9 [CCR9] and tumour necrosis factor [TNF]-Alfa.
The aim of this first-in-human, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial was to evaluate selective removal of circulating CCR9-expressing monocytes by leukapheresis in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, with regards to safety, tolerability, and immunological response.
Patients with ulcerative colitis were treated every second day with leukapheresis during five sessions with a C-C chemokine ligand 25 [CCL25; CCR9 ligand] column or a placebo column.
CC chemokine receptor type 9 (CCR9) activation by CCL25 plays a key role in leukocyte recruitment to the gut and represents a therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease.
The selective CCR9 antagonist vercirnon progressed to phase 3 clinical trials in Crohn's disease but efficacy was limited, with the need for very high doses to block receptor activation.
To investigate whether Imiquimod (IMQ) as TLR7 ligand protects mice from colonic inflammation and the mechanisms underlying in such immunoregulatory conditions.#　METHODS: Murine colitis was induced to Balb/c mice by administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) with or without daily intraperitoneal administration of IMQ.#　Colitis was evaluated by body weight decreases and by histological score.#　Also colonic mRNA expression was measured by RT-PCR.#　To confirm the induction of Regulatory T cells (Tregs) by type-1 IFN from pDCs, we generated mouse bone marrow-derived pDCs and co-cultured these with CD4+ T cells isolated from mouse spleen with or without IMQ stimulation.#　Cytokine production in the culture supernatant was measured by ELISA and the number of Tregs were analyzed by flow cytometry.#　Spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) from IMQ-treated mice were collected, and mRNA expressions of cytokine were measured by RT-PCR and cytokine productions were measured by ELISA.#　Tregs and chemokine expressions were analyzed in colon of TNBS-induced colitis mouse by immunohistochemistry.#　RESULTS: Administration of IMQ significantly suppressed colonic inflammation of TNBS-induced colitis.#　In the colons of IMQ-treated mice, mRNA expression of TNF-Alfa was decreased, and strong expressions of IL-6, IFN-Beta and TGF-Beta were detected.#　IL-10 and TGF-Beta productions were increased in the supernatant of co-cultured cells stimulated with IMQ, although we were unable to detect Treg differentiaton in IMQ-stimulated co-cultured cells.#　In MLN of IMQ-treated mice, strong expressions of TLR7, IFN-Beta, TGF-Beta and Foxp3 mRNA were detected.#　IL-10 production from MLN cells was also increased in the IMQ-treated group.#　Finally, Tregs in the inflamed colon and CCR9 in MLN of IMQ-treated mice were detected.#　CONCLUSION: These results suggest that IMQ protects mice from TNBS colitis through induction of CCR9, which regulates accumulation of Tregs in the inflamed colon.
We here showed that CCR9+ CD11b+ macrophages play an important role during the course of Concanavalin A-induced murine acute liver injury as well as human acute hepatitis via the production of inflammatory cytokines and the Th1 induction.
We found 54 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 5 genes associated with celiac disease (TAGAP, IL18R1, RGS21, PLEK, and CCR9) in time to celiac disease analyses (10-4&gt;P&gt;5.8x10-6).
Including chemokines [C-C motif ligand (CCL) 19, CCL20, CCL21, C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL) 6, CXCL10, and CXCL11] and soluble cytokine and chemokine receptors [soluble (s) interleukin (IL) 6 receptor (R), soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFR) 1, sTNFR2, and sIL-R2], ten inflammation-related markers, were nominally associated with diabetes (P&lt;0.05).
We identified mutations in melanoma-associated antigen D2 in all study participants and showed, in vivo and in vitro, reduced expression of the furosemide and thiazide sensitive transporters sodium-potassium-2-chloride cotransporter and sodium chloride cotransporter, respectively.
MAGED2 mutations caused X-linked polyhydramnios with prematurity and a severe but transient form of antenatal Bartter's syndrome.We distinguish two types of hereditary NDI: a 'pure' type with loss of water only and a complex type with loss of water and ions.
A new variant of this was recently identified: seven families were described with transient antenatal Bartter's syndrome, polyhydramnios and MAGED2 mutations.Multiple compounds have been identified experimentally that may stimulate urinary concentration independently of the vasopressin V2 receptor.
Fluorescent and radio conjugates of 11B6, an antibody targeting free hK2, are internalized and noninvasively report AR pathway activity in metastatic and genetically engineered models of cancer development and treatment.
Humanized 11B6, which has undergone toxicological tests in nonhuman primates, has the potential to improve patient management in these cancers.
MAGE-D2 is new gene found to cause severe polyhydramnios and transient postnatal Bartter-like syndrome.
These women were divided into two after breast cancer groups (BCG1 and BCG2) and a control group (CG).
Group BCG1 consisted of women who had undergone breast cancer surgery within the last 18months and BCG2 those whose postoperative periods were more than 18months.
The indices in millisecond, RMSSD (BCG1=19.83; BCG2=14.99; CG=31.46), SD1 (BCG1=14.03; BCG2=10.61; CG=22.27), SD2 (BCG1=39.17; BCG2=35.28; CG=61.16), SDNN (BCG1=29.58; BCG2=26.12; CG=46.36) and HF in milliseconds squared (BCG1=194.2; BCG2=91.07; CG=449.4) showed statistically significant reductions in the breast cancer groups compared to the CG (p&lt;=0.0001).
The discovery that mutations in MAGED2 cause a rare and transient form of antenatal Bartter's Syndrome may have implications beyond the very small number of affected families.
We identified a mutation in MAGED2 in each of the 13 infants in our analysis who had transient antenatal Bartter's syndrome.
MAGED2 encodes melanoma-associated antigen D2 (MAGE-D2) and maps to the X chromosome.
We also identified two different MAGED2 mutations in two families with idiopathic polyhydramnios.
We found that MAGED2 mutations caused X-linked polyhydramnios with prematurity and a severe but transient form of antenatal Bartter's syndrome.
Virulence factors profiling showed that most of MRSA isolates in our center carried the virulence factor pattern of cna-clfA-clfB-eno-fib-icaA-icaD-sea-psmAlfa-lukED-hlg-hlgv-hla-hld (214/239, 89.54%).
The main virulence genes in these strains were hlg (33.3%), scn (23.3%), cna (20%), hlb (20%), and clfA (18.3%), others including icaA, fnbA, tst, seb, hld, eta and sea.
Other virulence genes detected were (number of strains): tsst-1 (6), hla (15), hlb (9), hld (15), hlg (6), hlgv (9), cna (2), aur (14), and egc-like cluster (3).

FMT in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and metabolic syndrome should only be performed in research settings.
Blockade of CD69-Myl9/12 interaction ameliorates allergic airway inflammation in ovalbumin-induced and house dust mite-induced mouse models of asthma.
A greater activation of myosin, via increased phosphorylation of its regulatory light chain (LC20) by myosin light chain kinase, correlates with an increased Vmax in models of AH and in human asthmatic bronchial SM cells.
Some of the differentially expressed lncRNAs that were upregulated, such as AK124776, lincRNA-RAB12-1, KRT8P25, RP11-474J18.4, AC000110.1, KRT8P13, KRT8P10, BC072678, and downregulated, such as nc-HOXB9-206, RP11-160A10.2, nc-HOXA11-86, nc-HOXD10-7, nc-HOXB9-205, CES4, nc-HOXD12-3, systematic research on these lncRNAs will help clarify the mechanisms of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and guide the early diagnosis and treatment of this cancer in the future.
Proteins labeled with LCA were Rab-3, Rab-12, Rab-16, and M-Ras.
Moreover, the ANT2 precursors were observed to change in oncocytomas.
In particular, a high transcript level for the adenine nucleotide translocator isoform 2(ANT2) gene, which is usually not expressed in differentiated cells, was observed in oncocytoma and malignant urothelial renal tumor.
This study aimed to assess inflammatory, cardiac, renal and hematological markers in 56 breast cancer patients (BCP) before, during and after termination of chemotherapy with CYP and DOX.
Based on the results, we conclude that breast cancer and co-treatment of CYP and DOX interfere with various biological markers, thereby, showing the physiological imbalance.
Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) production via cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases closely correlates with the progression of breast cancer.
Here, we found that CYP3A4 expression and its epoxy-product, 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-EET) was enhanced in tamoxifen (TAM)-resistant MCF-7 (TAMR-MCF-7) breast cancer cells compared to control MCF-7 cells.
Our findings suggest that the CYP3A4-mediated EET pathway represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.
CYP3A4 was unexpectedly associated with breast cancer mitochondria and synthesized arachidonic acid (AA)-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which promoted the electron transport chain/respiration and inhibited AMPKAlfa.
CYP3A4 knockdown activated AMPKAlfa, promoted autophagy, and prevented mammary tumor formation.
Comprehensive genotyping of CYP enzymes and transporters was performed using the iPLEX ADME PGx Pro Panel in 302 tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients.
It has been recently reported that CD38 was highly expressed in adipose tissues from obese people and CD38-deficient mice were resistant to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity.
In this study, to explore the roles of CD38 in adipogenesis and lipogenesis in vivo and in vitro, obesity models were generated with male CD38-/- and WT mice fed with HFD.
The results showed that CD38-/- male mice were significantly resistant to HFD-induced obesity.
These results suggest that CD38 deficiency impairs adipogenesis and lipogenesis through activating Sirt1/PPARGamma-FASN signalling pathway during the development of obesity.
We also found that obesity development was associated with an increase in the number of CD38+ adipose progenitors, this effect being more pronounced in intra-abdominal than in subcutaneous fat, suggesting a higher rate of adipocyte commitment in visceral depots.
In this study, we show that CD45RO+CD38+ Beta cell Ag-specific CD4+ T cells were present at higher frequencies in type 1 diabetes subjects compared with those in healthy subjects.
Regulation of the SIRT/NAD system was associated with early (SIRT4, SIRT7, NAPRT1 and NMNAT2) and late phases (NMNAT3, NMRK2, ABCA1 and CD38) of glucose intolerance.
A total of eleven of genes were differently expressed in celiac patients compared with disease controls of which CD36, CD38, FOXP1, SELL, PPARA, PPARG, AGT previously associated with type 2 diabetes and AKAP6, NTNG1 with anorexia nervosa remained significant after correction for multiple testing.
PF significantly increased the expression of nuclear factor-YA (NF-YA), which strongly upregulated the molecules involved in the proteolytic machinery [molecular chaperones, carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein and transcription factor EB], which thus mitigated the behavioral and pathological impairments in an SBMA mouse model through the upregulation of pathogenic androgen receptor protein clearance in motor neurons and muscles.
One hundred and seven patients (49.3%) had no significant change in BP; 30.9% had intradialytic hypertension (IDHT) while 19.8% had intradialytic hypotension (IDH).
This week's articles describe ways to treat arthritis caused by chikungunya virus, IDH-mutant cancers, and hypertension.
On univariate analysis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension (HTN), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), smoking, hepatitis C, inadequate dialysis, intradialytic hypotension (IDH), interdialytic weight gain, low serum creatinine &lt;4 mg/dL, and anemia (Hb &lt;10 g/dL) were found to be statistically significantly different between frail and nonfrail groups On multivariate regression analysis, only HTN, PVD, CVA, anemia, smoking, and IDH were found to be significant.
Factors predicting frailty include HTN, smoking, LVD, PVD, CVA, smoking, anemia, and IDH.
Intradialytic hypertension (IDH) increases morbidity and mortality.
Intradialytic hypertension (ID-HTN) is an increasingly recognized phenomenon and although less common than IDH, portends poor cardiovascular prognosis as well as reflects higher hypertension burden in the dialysis population.
Dry weight, hypertension, and phosphorus levels are modifiable risk factors to possibly reduce the rate of IDH episodes.
We believe that all hypertension guidelines should follow the National Institute for Health and Excellence (NICE) and make IDP and CTD first choice 'thiazide-like diuretics.'
Immunohistochemical analysis with the anti-SOX6 antibody showed that all the glioma tissues analyzed (14 glioblastomas, 14 anaplastic astrocytomas, 3 anaplastic oligoastrocytomas, 5 diffuse astrocytomas, 1 oligodendroglioma, and 1 pilocytic astrocytoma) expressed SOX6 in tumor cells, but only a few SOX6-positive cells were detected in nonneoplastic tissues from the cerebral cortex.
To address these issues, we analyzed the production of proinflammatory mediators in mouse thyroid organs and demonstrate consistency with in vitro studies performed previously that Il1alpha, Il1beta, Il6, and Tnfalpha and the enzyme Cox2 are produced by RP3-transgenic thyroid tissue, but absent from nontransgenic thyroids.
With a few exceptions, higher circulating levels of endostatin seem to reflect vascular and myocardial damage, and a worsened prognosis for cardiovascular events or mortality in individuals with hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, as well as in the general population.
Endostatin is one of the main angiostatic mediators, and inhibits angiogenesis and prevents progression of atherosclerosis.
For ischemic versus hemorrhagic strokes comparison, NT-proBNP (N-Terminal Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide) &gt;4.9 (odds ratio, 2.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.55-3.71; P&lt;0.0001) and endostatin &gt;4.7 (odds ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-3.45; P=0.010), together with age, sex, blood pressure, stroke severity, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, were included in the model.
In patients with coronary heart disease, the count of endothelial progenitor cells was lower by 4 times, the level of VEGF was higher by 52%, and the level of endostatin was lower by 13% than in healthy volunteers.
To examine the association between the serum endostatin levels and subclinical atherosclerosis independent of traditional risk factors in a healthy Japanese population.
A higher serum endostatin level reflected subclinical atherosclerosis in this Japanese population.
The most common diseases among humanitarian cases were benign tumors (29%, 5/17), cranioplasty (23%, 4/17), obstructive hydrocephalus (11%, 2/17), nonobstructive hydrocephalus (11%, 2/17), hemifacial spasm (11%, 2/17), and cerebral angiography (11%, 2/17).
Twenty-seven (33.8%) patients developed ARE, 5 (6%) developed hydrocephalus, 10 (12.5%) reported new ataxia, 17 (21%) developed trigeminal dysfunction, 3 (3.75%) had facial weakness, and 1 patient developed hemifacial spasm.
Twelve factors, including gender, hypertension, intracranial aneurysm, cerebral vascular spasm, hydrocephalus and conscious disturbance during hospitalization, smoking, age, WFNS (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons) scale, Fisher grade, white blood cell count and blood glucose level at admission, were analyzed by using Chi-square test, t test, and Logistic multiple regression analysis.
We studied 37 patients with spasm, trisomy 21, prematurity, epilepsy, psychomotor retardation, and/or hydrocephalus (study group) and 67 control patients, all between 14 months and 14 years of age.
Surgical treatment after radiosurgery or radiotherapy may be necessary for tumors that continue to grow, or for patients who develop brainstem compressive symptoms, disabling hemifacial spasm, or hydrocephalus.
Among these, 236 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were statistically significant, including many DEGs that were novel in cervical cancer, including gastrulation brain homeobox 2,5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1D and endothelin 3.
A total of 5 overlapping genes [dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4); endothelin 3 (EDN3); fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14); tachykinin, precursor 1 (TAC1); and wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 16 (WNT16)] between the 561 overlapping differentially methylated genes and the 242 DEGs were identified, which were downregulated and hypermethylated simultaneously in cervical cancer samples.
Employing functions of several bioinformatics tools, we selected 143 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the cervical cancer.
The results of bioinformatics analysis show that these DEGs play important roles in the development of cervical cancer.
A total of 1,160 and 756 DEGs were identified in the pre-invasive and invasive stages of cervical cancer, respectively.
Survival analysis then revealed a five-PcG gene signature one protective gene (enhancer of zeste homolog 1) and four risky genes (EZH2, PHD finger protein 19, DNMT3A and DNMT3B), which may identify patients with high risk of poor prognosis of glioma.
In this study, we exploited this platform to evaluate the behavior of two biodegradable formulations, poly-Epsilon-caprolactone (PCL3) and poly lactic-acid (PLA8), respectively, in cellular and animal models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
Interestingly, changes in EZH2, PHF19, CBX7, CBX6 and EZH1 occurred progressively as astrocytoma grade increased.
In this report, we show that PHF19 silencing reduces the cell proliferation rate and increases the transendothelial migration capacities of melanoma cell lines.
Our data therefore indicate the role of PHF19 and its upstream regulator, Akt, in the phenotype switch of melanoma cells from proliferative to invasive states.
Interestingly, the products of the hPCL3 gene, particularly the short form, hPCL3S, are markedly overexpressed in many types of cancers, including colon, skin, lung, rectal, cervical, uterus, and liver cancers.
Both hPCL3S and hPCL3L messages were increased dramatically in most cell lines derived from various stages of melanoma and glioma tumor progression.
Fifty patients (19 males and 31 females, mean age 52.4 y) showed sagging posterior layer TLF, and 32 of them developed &gt;=1 junctional problems, such as retrolistheses (n=25), compression fractures (n=5), spondylolistheses (n=4), progressive scoliosis (n=4), and segmental instability with bone marrow change (n=2).
However, the patients with thoracolumbar fracture (TLF) had significantly more MSCs than those with degenerative disc disease (DDD), but not for NCs.
Common physiological pathways are involved in several ARCA, such as DNA repair deficiency (AOA1, ataxia telangiectasia [AT]...), RNA termination disorder (AOA2), mitochondrial defect (FRDA, sensory ataxic neuropathy with dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia [Sando]...), lipoprotein assembly defects (AVED, abetalipoproteinemia [ABL]), chaperon protein disorders (ARSACS, Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome [MSS]) or peroxysomal diseases (Refsum disease [RD]).
While Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and ataxia telangiectasia (AT) are known to be the two most frequent forms of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA), knowledge on the other forms of ARCA has been obtained only recently, and they appear to be rarer.
Transcription factor MEF2C regulates multiple genes linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and human MEF2C haploinsufficiency results in ASD, intellectual disability, and epilepsy.
The microRNAs target a group of genes enriched for synaptic signaling and epilepsy risk, including SLC12A5, SYT1, GRIN2A, GRIN2B, KCNB1, SCN2A, TSC1, and MEF2C.
Genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses implicated that increased risk of developing Alzheimer's diseases (AD) has been associated with the ABCA7, APOE, BIN1, CASS4, CD2AP, CD33, CELF1, CLU, CR1, DSG2, EPHA1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB4, INPP5D, MEF2C, MS4A4A, MS4A4E, MS4A6E, NME8, PICALM, PLD3, PTK2B, RIN3, SLC24A4, SORL1, and ZCWPW1 genes.
Epilepsy-causing SIK1 sequence variations resulted in abnormalities in the MEF2C-ARC pathway of neuronal development and synapse activity response.
This work provides the first insights into the mechanisms of pathogenesis in SIK1 syndrome, and extends the ARX-MEF2C pathway in the pathogenesis of developmental epilepsy.
A common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs190982) in MEF2C gene was identified to be related to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Caucasians in a large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
A key factor protecting from oxidative stress in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is paraoxonase-1 (PON1).
In this study our aim was to evaluate paraoxonase (PON1) activity and free sulfhydryl groups (-SH) as antioxidative parameters and lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) as oxidative parameter in the serum of women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and determine their relation with the degree of subclinical atherosclerosis.
To clarify the levels of protein oxidation markers such as protein carbonyl (PCO), protein hydroperoxides (P-OOH), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and nitrotyrosine (NT), as well as antioxidative enzymes such as paraoxonase (PON-1) in women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
Recently, numerous new antibodies defining the characteristic clinical phenotype have been described as anti-MDA5 antibodies associated with interstitial lung disease and amyopathic dermatomyositis or anti-TIF1Gamma antibodies as markers for paraneoplastic dermatomyositis.
PM is associated with anti-synthetase antibodies (anti-Jo-1, PL-7, PL-12, OJ, and EJ) and DM with anti-Mi-2, anti-SAE, anti-TIF-1-Gamma and anti-NXP2 (both associated with cancer) or anti-MDA5 antibodies (associated with interstitial lung disease).
Twenty-six (43.3%) PM/DM-ILD patients were anti-aminoacyl tRNA-synthetase antibody-positive (anti-ARS-positive), 15 (25.0%) were anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody-positive (anti-MDA5-positive), 3 (5%) were anti-signal recognition particle antibody-positive, 1 (1.7%) was anti-transcriptional intermediary factor 1-gamma antibody-positive, and 15 (25%) were MSA-negative.
Antibodies to transcription intermediary factor 1Gamma/Alfa (TIF1Gamma/Alfa, p155/140) are frequently found in DM associated with malignancy while anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5; CADM140) are associated with clinically amyopathic DM (CADM) complicated by rapidly progressive ILD.
Anti-TIF-1Gamma positive patients were less likely to have systemic features including interstitial lung disease, Raynaud phenomenon, and arthritis/arthralgia.
The frequency of pulmonary fibrosis during the disease progression was 2/12, 1/4 and 1/4 in anti-TIF1Gamma, anti-NXP2 and anti-SAE, respectively.
Each of the identified mutations altered the equilibrium between alternative GR conformations distinctively, indicating that the Hsp90 dependence of SRs may correlate with differences in the conformational dynamics of these receptors.
The ubiquitous heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) has been shown to participate directly in the function of a wide variety of cellular signal transduction components, including steroid receptors (SRs).
However, there is still no direct evidence for an in vivo association of SRs with hsp90.
The results suggest that the interaction of SRs with the hsp90 is minimal when compared to a bona fide type of interaction with the co-factors.
To address the role of endothelial Cx43 in this process, we analyzed Cx43 regulation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in the proximity of Cx43high (DU-145 and MAT-LyLu) and Cx43low prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and AT-2).
The data on the nature of AT2-R expression in prostate tissue of prostate cancer patients may be considered as a tool for predicting biochemical recurrence after combined hormone and radiation therapy.
The present study found that, similarly to 5-fluorouracil, low concentrations (1-10 myM) of 9-aminoacridine (9-AAA) inhibited the growth of the two rat prostate cancer AT-2 and Mat-LyLu cell lines and the human melanoma A375 cell line.
Furthermore, our previous studies indicate that increased expression of Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) alone induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer lines, an effect that did not require Ang II.
Human prostate cancer DU145 xenograft mouse model was used to assess the effect of AT2R on tumor growth in vivo.
The results showed that AT2R overexpression can inhibit tumor growth of prostate cancer in vivo by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells.
The aim of the present study was the evaluation of AT1 and AT2 expressions in human prostate cancers.
The data on AT1 and AT2 receptor expressions may suggest the involvement of RAS in prostate cancerogenesis.
sartanes) and/or AT2 agonists in prostate cancer prophylaxis and/or treatment.
The results indicate that CEGA using the new circular stapling device in surgery of the esophageal carcinoma is a very effective procedure to improve the anastomotic technique from a traditional hand-sewn anastomosis to a stapled anastomosis and can reduce the incidence of complications.
An unusual retinal pigment epitheliopathy resembling ophthalmomyiasis interna posterior (OMI) is endemic to Guam.
Toxicity, such as mucositis, leukocytopenia and neutropenia, was higher in ConcCRTx than in CTx followed by RTx.
At the 4th dose level (Ctx 1400 mg/m2, Epidx 100 mg/m2, 5-Fu 600 mg/m2), two patients had dose-limiting mucositis and one patient developed dose-limiting neutropenia.
Therefore, the effect of CKD on the disposition of CYP1A2-metabolized, CYP2C8-metabolized, CYP2C9-metabolized, CYP2C19-metabolized, and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)-transported drugs was investigated.
We identified dedicated CKD studies with 6, 5, 6, 4, and 12 "model" substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and OATP, respectively.
In contrast, the effect of CKD on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 was variable and modest compared to CYP2C8 and OATP.
To investigate the impact of genetic variants in CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 on the efficacy of cyclophosphamide (CYC) therapy in patients with lupus nephritis.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) complicates warfarin anticoagulation partially through its effect on CYP2C9 activity.
CKD increased the effect of CYP2C9 genetic variation on (S)-warfarin and (R,S)-warfarin metabolism.
Tecarfarin exposure was similar between the HVs and the CKD subjects regardless of CYP2C9 genotype.
The CYP2C9 pathway (4-hydroxyflurbiprofen formation clearance) was similar in all the patients with CKD and was concordant with previous reports of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and healthy controls.
For flurbiprofen, patients with glomerulonephritis had higher oral clearance than those with nonglomerular CKD, suggesting higher unbound fraction and enhanced metabolism through other (non-CYP2C9) routes.
The current study suggests no statistically significant differences in the in vivo activity of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in patients with either glomerulonephritis or nonglomerular CKD.
We examined whether the renin inhibitor, aliskiren, provides similar or greater protection than ACE inhibition from non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and from the proliferative neoangiogenesis of oxygen-induced retinopathy.
To assess angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels in aqueous humor and plasma of patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) as another potent ischemia-induced angiogenic factor.
We observed significantly elevated ACE level in aqueous humor of patients with PDR compared with the patients with NPDR and normal subjects (P = 0.023), but no significant difference was detected between nonproliferative diabetics and control group (P = 0.239).
Studies exploring the association between ACE I/D polymorphism and BDR or PDR may help us better understand the genetics of DR.
To evaluate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) in retarding progression of severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients.
This was a retrospective case control study of 128 patients with normotensive type 2 diabetes with lower than +1 dipstick proteinuria and severe NPDR who were classified into either an ACE-I treated group (Enalapril maleate 10 mg, n=12 , Ramipril 5 mg, n=17) or an ACE-I untreated group (n=99).
Small doses of ACE-I did not yield any beneficial effects in retarding the progression of severe NPDR.
A7730C variant which showed a high mutation frequency in cervical cancer was predicted to be a binding site for the cellular transcription factor PHOX2A.
miR-326 regulates cell proliferation and migration in lung cancer by targeting Phox2a and is regulated by HOTAIR.
PHOX2B and its paralogue gene PHOX2A are two homeodomain proteins in the network regulating the development of autonomic ganglia that have been associated with the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma (NB), because of their over-expression in different NB cell lines and tumour samples.
To identify novel abnormally methylated genes in early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we analyzed the methylation status of 13 genes (ALX1, BCL2, FOXL2, HPP1, MYF6, OC2, PDGFRA, PHOX2A, PITX2, RARB, SIX6, SMPD3 and SOX1) in cancer tissues from 101 cases of stage I NSCLC patients and lung tissues from 30 cases of non-cancerous lung disease controls, using methylation-specific PCR (MSP).
The methylation frequencies (29.70-64.36%) of 7 genes (MYF6, SIX6, SOX1, RARB, BCL2, PHOX2A and FOLX2) in stage I NSCLC were significantly higher compared with those in non-cancerous lung disease controls (P&lt;0.05).
Furthermore, we also detected the expression of 8 pathological markers (VEGF, HER-2, P53, P21, EGFR, CHGA, SYN and EMA) in cancer tissues of stage I NSCLC by immunohistochemistry, and found that high expression levels of p53 and CHGA were associated with the methylation of BCL2 (P=0.025) and PHOX2A (P=0.023), respectively.
In this study, among the 7 genes which demonstrated hypermethylation in stage I NSCLC compared with non-cancerous lung diseases, 5 genes (MYF6, SIX6, PHOX2A, FOLX2 and SOX1) were found for the first time to be abonormally methylated in NSCLC.
Heteroplasmic m.3697G&gt;A has been reported in patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes and Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome.
These can be grouped into disorders with reduced papillae (Machado-Joseph disease, Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome, familial dysautonomia, dystonia musculorum, and Behcet's disease) and those with taste defects only (Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV, and diabetes mellitus).
We used in-situ hybridization to analyze the expression patterns of three known members (a, b and c) of the RGM ("repulsive guidance molecule") gene family and of the RGMa receptor neogenin in a glaucoma mouse model (DBA/2J strain) and the C57BL/6J strain, which served as a control.
In order to understand the role of the RGMs and neogenin in glaucoma, we characterized their expression patterns in the developing and mature mouse retina and in the optic nerve.
Interestingly, we found a higher expression of RGMa, RGMb and neogenin in the retinas of all glaucoma-affected mice than in the age-matched control strain.
A tool developed for their use--DeAR GP (Dementia Assessment Referral to GP)--empowers care home staff, makes more efficient use of GPs' and specialist memory nurses' time, and improves diagnosis of dementia.
Using homozygous mice for an autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets-FGF23 mutation or animals treated with a furin inhibitor, we showed that cFGF23 and iFGF23 levels increased equivalently after PTH injection.
We discuss in this review the current implications of GRx and/or glutathionylation in the inflammatory response and in diseases associated with chronic inflammation, namely diabetes, atherosclerosis, inflammatory lung disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease, and in viral infections.
In addition to arising from the procedure per se, a genetic or cytogenetic abnormality in offspring of an ICSI pregnancy could arise as result of offspring inheriting the mutant gene or chromosomal abnormality conferring paternal infertility: Y deletions (DAZ) in oligospermia males, cystic fibrosis in offspring of males with congenital bilateral absence vas deferens (CBAVD), and sex chromosomal abnormalities in offspring of Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) males.
Two recent candidate genes, ErbB3 and Fgfr1, are growth factors whose mRNA levels have been found to be altered in the leukocytes of patients that are affected by bipolar disorder in a depressive state.
Molecular genetics and developmental studies have identified 21 genes in this region (ADRA1A, ARHGEF10, CHRNA2, CHRNA6, CHRNB3, DKK4, DPYSL2, EGR3, FGF17, FGF20, FGFR1, FZD3, LDL, NAT2, NEF3, NRG1, PCM1, PLAT, PPP3CC, SFRP1 and VMAT1/SLC18A1) that are most likely to contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder and depression), neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease) and cancer.
The region on chromosome 3p13-p14 known to contain several chromosomal translocation breakpoints in families with "pure familial renal cell carcinoma" is quite proximal to the VHL locus in 3p25-p26 we have identified.
Immunohistochemical studies and TCR gamma gene rearrangement analysis using a polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for V gamma 1-8 and V gamma 9 gene segments in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR/ DGGE) were performed on frozen material of 11 pseudo-T-cell lymphomas and 17 CTCLs, including 9 cases of mycosis fungoides (MF) and 8 pleomorphic CTCLs.
Unclassifiable cutaneous T-cell lymphoma was also diagnosed in the second patient: it was associated with a monoclonal proliferation of T-cell receptor V gamma 9, delta + large granular T lymphocytes and finally developed into frank, acute pre-T lymphatic leukemia.
In addition to providing insight into Pol I transcription and ES control, Pol I transcription inhibitors potentially also provide new approaches to treat trypanosomiasis.
In the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African sleeping sickness, TbISWI down-regulates RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-transcribed variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) gene expression sites (ESs), which are monoallelically expressed.
A significant association was found between the perilipin rs1052700 polymorphism and T2D, and between the FTO rs3751812 polymorphism and obesity (P = 0.03 and 0.003, respectively); however, no significant relationship was found between rs3751812 and T2D.
The perilipin rs1052700 polymorphism is related to T2D but not obesity.
This prospective study recruited 22 patients with ESRD who underwent a first living kidney allograft transplantation, comprising 12 patients with CYP3A5*1 allele (CYP3A5*1/*1 or *1/*3) and 10 patients without CYP3A5*1 allele (CYP3A5*3/*3).
Nineteen SNPs in the ABCB1, NR1I2, UGT1A1, SLCO1B1 and CYP3A5 genes were examined in case patients with atazanavir/ritonavir-induced nephrolithiasis (n = 31) and controls (n = 47).
Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) use is considered to play a major role in the development of CKD after LT. We studied the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of the donor and recipient CNI-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A5 and the CNI-transporting ABCB1 on the development of CKD after LT. Tacrolimus (Tac) predose concentrations at different time-points after transplantation and the CYP3A5 6986A&gt;G and ABCB1 3435C&gt;T SNPs were determined in 125 LT recipients and their respective donors to study the influence of Tac predose levels and genetics on the development of CKD.
Neither did we find a correlation between the investigated SNPs in either donor or recipient ABCB1 and CYP3A5 genes (or combinations thereof) and the development of CKD.
An individual's risk of developing CKD after LT is not associated with genetic variation in either recipient or donor CYP3A5 or ABCB1 genotype status.
In conclusion, these results suggest that CYP3A5 polymorphism and plasma concentration of 3-INDS may account for the interindividual variability of CYP3A activity, and that plasma concentration of 3-INDS may partially explain the gap in CYP3A activity that cannot be explained by genetic contribution in patients with renal failure.

Filtered albumin has been suggested to be a cause of the glomerular and tubular injuries observed at advanced stages of Alport syndrome.
To directly investigate the role that albumin plays in the progression of disease in Alport syndrome, we generated albumin knockout (Alb(-/-)) mice to use as a tool for removing albuminuria as a component of kidney disease.
Alb mutant mice were bred to collagen-Alfa3(IV) knockout (Col4a3(-/-)) mice, which are a model for human Alport syndrome.
We conclude that filtered albumin is injurious to kidney cells in Alport syndrome and perhaps in other proteinuric kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy.
On the other hand, we believe that tumor depth of invasion (&gt;=4 mm), POI, and VEGF-C expression all need to be considered in the preoperative and postoperative planning stages for tongue cancer treatment.
The use of a therapeutic approach which blocks lymphangiogenic factors, such as VEGF-C and VEGF-D, may be beneficial in suppressing the lymphatic spread of tongue cancer with intense intranodal lymphangiogenesis.
VEGF, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and MIA expression levels of metastatic tongue cancer HSC-3 cells were higher than those with no metastatic HSC-4 cells, and VEGF, VEGF-C and VEGF-D expression levels were decreased by MIA siRNA treatment in both cells.
Vascular endothelial growth factor and Notch1 expression are significantly related to cervical lymph node metastasis and depth of invasion in tongue cancer patients.
Mutant-type p53 and VEGF are known to be related to angiogenesis, and maspin is a potent angiogenic inhibitor but its role in tongue cancer has scarcely been examined.
We observed the expression of maspin, mutant-type p53 and VEGF by immunohistochemistry in 33 patients with stages I and II oral tongue cancer.
In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of CNS autoimmunity, we found activation-induced cytidine deaminase, a GC-defining enzyme, in meningeal ELT (mELT) densely populated by B and T cells.
A prospective randomized survey of 113 abortions carried out by 1 operator using a single technique among women in the 7th-10th week of amenorrhea was undertaken to test the effectiveness of systemically administered oxytocins to reduce bleeding during therapeutic abortion by suction.
This cross-sectional study includes 304 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (ADOs) and a glomerular filtration rate (estimated GFR) &amp;lt;60ml/min/1.73m2.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that acute hyperglycaemia in hearts of rats without diabetes alters coronary vascular responses to nitric oxide (NO), adenosine (ADO) and phenylephrine (PHE).
In conclusion, STZ-diabetes mellitus enhances the antiphosphaturic effect of ADO by mechanisms unrelated to ADO A1 receptor stimulation.
Bradykinin type 1 receptor antagonism could represent a promising therapeutic tool in combination with TZD for the treatment of T2D, obesity and insulin resistance.
The aim of this study was to analyze the acute responses of bradykinin, insulin, and glycemia to exercise performed above and below lactate threshold (LT) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).
To examine the association of bradykinin and related peptides with the development of diabetic nephropathy lesions in 243 participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D) from the Renin-Angiotensin System Study who, at baseline, were normoalbuminuric, normotensive and had normal or increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
Heterozygosity for missense mutations in Seipin, namely N88S and S90L, leads to a broad spectrum of motor neuropathy, while a number of loss-of-function mutations in Seipin are associated with the Berardinelli-Seip congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 2 (CGL2, BSCL2), a condition that is characterized by severe lipoatrophy, insulin resistance, and intellectual impairment.
In comparison to liver biopsies of patients with non-viral liver disease, liver biopsies of patients with HCV showed significantly increased mRNA expression of IL-28A and IL-29.
Here, we demonstrate a key regulatory role of IL-28A in T-cell-mediated hepatitis.
IL-28A induced TH1 cytokine production by CD4+ T lymphocytes in a T-bet-dependent manner and was up-regulated in a murine model of T-cell-mediated hepatitis upon Con A administration.
In addition, IL-28A-transgenic mice showed markedly augmented Con A-induced hepatitis with up-regulated interferon-gamma cytokine production, as compared with wild-type mice.
In addition, in vivo blockade of interferon-gamma but not IL-4 suppressed augmented liver inflammation in transgenic mice, suggesting that IL-28A induces the T-bet signaling pathway in T-cell-induced hepatitis.
Thus, targeting of IL-28A represents a potential novel approach for therapy of Th1-mediated inflammatory diseases such as T-cell-mediated hepatitis.
The present study therefore indicated that NOD receptor and TLR9 may modulate the inflammatory response and further impact upon intestinal injury of SAP, via the regulation of NF-KB expression and the oxidation/antioxidation balance, suggesting therapeutically targeting NOD receptor and TLR9 might be a useful approach for the treatment of severe acute pancreatitis.
It also has efficacy in limiting TLR9-mediated sterile inflammation in in vivo models of acute liver injury and acute pancreatitis.
Genetic deletion and pharmacologic antagonism demonstrate that specific DAMP receptors, including Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, TLR9, and P2X7, are also required for inflammation in experimental acute pancreatitis.
Acute pancreatitis was induced by caerulein stimulation in wild-type mice and mice deficient in components of the inflammasome (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain [ASC], NLRP3, caspase-1), Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), or the purinergic receptor P2X(7).
Additionally, wild-type mice were pretreated with a TLR9 antagonist before induction of acute pancreatitis by caerulein or retrograde bile duct infusion of taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate.
TLR9 and P2X(7) are important DAMP receptors upstream of inflammasome activation, and their antagonism could provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating acute pancreatitis.
We are currently screening the 113 candidate DFNB79 genes for mutations and have excluded CACNA1B, EDF1, PTGDS, EHMT1, QSOX2, NOTCH1, MIR126 and MIR602.
Exposure to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 was found to enhance a TrkAhigh/CD15-/CD184- neuroblastoma cellular subset, accompanied by a reduction in doublecortin-positive neuroblasts and of NMYC protein expression in SH-SY5Y cells.
Recent studies indicate that C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and its ligand, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), stimulate expression of the cell cycle regulatory protein Cyclin D1 in neurofibromatosis 1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells and promote their proliferation.
Western blot analysis revealed the expression of multiple CXCR4 isoforms in neuroblastoma cells.
Our data suggest a modulatory role of the MSC secretome on the expression of the 47 kDa CXCR4 isoform and invasion potential of the neuroblastoma cells to the bone marrow.
In this study, we investigated the role of NF-KB signaling pathway in the regulation of CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) in neuroblastoma metastasis.
Targeting NF-KB signalling pathways and ultimately CXCR4 could be a strategy in neuroblastoma therapy.
The FAM3C interleukin-like epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) inducer (ILEI) has been shown to be strongly up-regulated in several cancers and to be essential for tumor formation and metastasis in epithelial cells, correlating with a significant decrease in overall survival in colon and breast cancer patients.
Interleukin-like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition inducer (ILEI) is an essential cytokine in tumor progression that is upregulated in several cancers, and its altered subcellular localization is a predictor of poor survival in human breast cancer.
Murine mammary tumor and metastasis models of EpC40 and 4T1 cells overexpressing different mutant forms of ILEI were used-extended with in vivo aprotinin treatment for the inhibition of ILEI-processing proteases-to test the in vivo relevance of proteolytic cleavage.
Immunohistochemistry for ILEI localization and uPAR expression was performed on two human breast cancer arrays, and ILEI and uPAR scores were correlated with the metastasis-free survival of patients.
Moreover, altered subcellular ILEI localization strongly correlates with high tumor cell-associated uPAR protein expression, as well as with poor survival, in human breast cancer.
Our findings point out extracellular serine proteases, in particular plasmin, and uPAR as valuable therapeutic targets against ILEI-driven tumor progression and emphasize the prognostic relevance of ILEI localization and a combined ILEI-uPAR marker analysis in human breast cancer.
ILEI is overexpressed and/or altered in intracellular localization in multiple human tumors, an event strongly correlated to invasion/EMT, metastasis formation, and survival in human colon and breast cancer.
Keeping in view the fact that molecular basis of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is poorly understood, we attempted to explore the small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated c-myc gene regulation using BL-derived EB-3 cell line as archetype cellular model.
With other procedures, as anti-complement immunoperoxidase (ACIP) and anti-IgG immunoperoxidase (AIIP) the Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen (EBNA) was detected precisely in EB3, Jijoye and Raji lymphocytes using anti-EBNA antibodies from patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma or Burkitt lymphoma, in dilution 1:10-1:5120.
The virus in the EB-3 cell line derived from a Burkitt lymphoma was partially purified by digestion with proteolytic enzyme and by density-gradient centrifugation on potassium tartrate.
This conjugate proved to be a potent cytotoxin for surface Ig positive Burkitt lymphoma EB-3 cells, growing in vitro and produced 50% inhibition of protein synthesis at level of 1.4 x 10(-9) M. When tested for cytotoxic action on target cells, the composite conjugate molecule was at least 100 times more effective than antibodies alone, ricin A-chain alone or a conjugate ricin A-chain--normal rabbit IgG.
The interaction of poly- and monoclonal antibodies against the L-chain of human Ig with Burkitt lymphoma EB-3 cells was studied using a fluorescent lipid probe, anthrylvinyl-labelled sphingomyelin, incorporated into the cell plasma membrane.
The only gangliosides in Burkitt's lymphoma EB-3 cells is GM3.
Treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma EB-3 cells with gangliosides GM1 or GM3 results in their binding to and partial incorporation into the cell membrane.
We sought to investigate the renoprotection of CIRP in a rat model of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
Overexpression and knockdown of CIRP were achieved in vivo by directly injecting lentivirus vectors containing packaging lentivirus (pL)/internal ribosome entry site (IRES)/green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CIRP or pL/short hairpin RNA (shRNA)/F-cold inducible RNA binding protein (F-CIRP)-A into the renal parenchyma of rats 7 days before deep hypothermic circulatory arrest under the ultrasound guidance.
Our findings suggest that the CIRP exerts a robust renoprotective effect by inhibiting apoptosis in the rat model of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
Compared with baseline, rats resuscitated from cardiac arrest showed increased expression of CIRP, Bax, Caspase 9, and Caspase 3 and decreased expression of Bcl-2 in hippocampus (P &lt; 0.05).
Our findings suggest that 32 C therapeutic hypothermia exerts an important neuroprotective effects by up-regulating CIRP expression and inhibiting mitochondrial apoptosis factor production in the cardiac arrest rat model.
A previously reported expression signature of three genes (IGFBP3, F3 and VGLL3) was shown to have potential prognostic value in estimating overall and cancer-specific survivals at diagnosis of prostate cancer in a pilot cohort study using freshly frozen Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) samples.
Multiple biopsy samples from 43 patients were evaluated using a previously reported gene signature of IGFBP3, F3 and VGLL3 with potential prognostic value in estimating overall survival at diagnosis of prostate cancer.
The gene expression levels of IGFBP3 and F3 in prostate cancer epithelial cell-containing tissue representing the primary and secondary Gleason patterns were high and consistent, while the low expressed VGLL3 showed more variation in its expression levels.
Previous studies have implicated vestigial like 3 (VGLL3), a chromosome 3p12.3 gene that encodes a putative transcription co-factor, as a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSC), the most common type of epithelial ovarian cancer.
A complementation analysis based on microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) using a centric fragment of chromosome 3 (der3p12-q12.1) into the OV-90 ovarian cancer cell line haploinsufficient for 3p and lacking VGLL3 expression was performed to assess the effect on tumorigenic potential and growth characteristics.
Interestingly, underexpression of VGLL3 and ZNF654 were observed in malignant ovarian tumor samples as compared with primary cultures of normal ovarian surface epithelial cells or benign ovarian tumors, and this occurred regardless of allelic content of 3p12.3-pcen.
We tested the effects of the MEK inhibitor RDEA119, the Akt inhibitor perifosine, and the HDAC inhibitor SAHA on NIS expression in thirteen human cancer cell lines derived from melanoma, hepatic carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, colon carcinoma, breast carcinoma, and brain cancers.
Here, we report that escape of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells or colorectal cancer cells from dormancy is associated with Dll4 expression in the tumor microenvironment and increased Notch3 signaling in tumor cells.
APOBEC1 could be involved in cancer promotion at the very early stages of carcinogenesis, as it is highly expressed in Barrett's esophagus, a condition often associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma.
The differential diagnosis includes Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome, neurofibromatosis, Milroy disease, and Proteus syndrome.
Notably, new experimental data have shown protective immune responses of bee venom group III sPLA2 against a wide range of diseases including asthma, Parkinson's disease, and drug-induced organ inflammation.
Snake venom are known containing PLA2s (svPLA2s) which exhibit a wide variety of pharmacological effects including neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, myotoxicity and hemorrhage.
This study was aimed to assess regulation of surface-membrane enzymes such as Delta-6-desaturase (FADS2), secretory Phospholipase A2(sPLA2) by hemp seed and evening primrose oils as well as Hot-natured dietary intervention in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients.
Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) are enzymes responsible for inflammatory effects, edema formation, myotoxicity, neurotoxicity and other manifestations from envenoming.
Defects of CIB2, calcium- and integrin-binding protein 2, have been reported to cause isolated deafness, DFNB48 and Usher syndrome type-IJ, characterized by congenital profound deafness, balance defects and blindness.
Here, we report that mutations in CIB2, which encodes a calcium- and integrin-binding protein, are associated with nonsyndromic deafness (DFNB48) and Usher syndrome type 1J (USH1J).
In polymyositis and inclusion body myositis, KIF4 cells were mainly located around individual muscle fibers, whereas in dermatomyositis, they were also near blood vessels.
CD9 expression obviously increased bortezomib sensitivity through inducing apoptosis, significantly inhibiting U266 cells' adhesion to HS-5 and primary bone marrow stromal cells, but increasing U266 cells' adhesion to fibronectin.
The immunoprofiles of MOLP-6 and MOLP-7 correspond to that seen typically in primary MM cells: positive for cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig) chains, a heavy and kappa light chains, CD9, CD28, CD40, CD44, CD45, CD56, and PCA-1; the cells were negative for surface Igs and various other B-cell, T-cell and myelomonocyte associated markers.
The univariate analysis showed that five parameters had an adverse effect on both complete remission (CR) and survival: advanced age (greater than 60 years), anemia (hemoglobin concentration (Hb) less than 10g/dl), the expression of the antigens detected by the anti-megakaryocytic antibodies (CDw41/CDw42), the monocytic antibodies (CD14), and the CD9 (FMC56, FMC8) antigen.
In this review, we consider the following paraneoplastic hormonal syndromes: malign hypercalcaemia, hyponatraemia (inappropiate secretion of the antidiuretic hormone), ectopic Cushing's syndrome, ectopic acromegaly, hypoglycaemia due to tumours different from those of the islet cells and paraneoplastic gynaecomastia; we make a brief final reference to other hormones (calcitonin, somatostatin, and VIP).
Protrudin was found to interact with other HSP-related proteins including myelin proteolipid protein 1 (SPG2), atlastin-1 (SPG3A), REEP1 (SPG31), REEP5 (similar to REEP1), Kif5A (SPG10), Kif5B, Kif5C, and reticulon 1, 3, and 4 (similar to reticulon 2, SPG12).
Downregulation of ACE2 is always associated with the ALI or ARDS induced by avian influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus and sepsis.
A virus infection assay showed that rWIV1-DeltaX replicated as efficiently as rWIV1 in Vero E6, Calu-3, and HeLa-hACE2 cells.
Results show that 106 cases of tetanus occurred in Aceh, with a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 18.9%; 71 cases occurred in Yogyakarta, with CFR of 36.6%.
Treatment of (DR-BB x WF)F1 x WF animals (all lyp+/+) using a standard induction protocol caused type 1 diabetes in 58% of progeny.
All genetic analyses of BB rat diabetes to date have backcrossed to the DP-BB strain or used (DP-BB x non-BB)F2 animals to ensure that a fraction of progeny are homozygous for lyp.
Since, type 1 diabetes is characterised by hyperglycaemia we analysed 22 diabetic and 43 non-diabetic [(BB x SHR)FI x BB] backcross hybrids (28M:37F) which were already homozygous for Iddml and Iddm2 to search for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting blood glucose in BB/OK rats.
This prompted us to investigate the inheritance of IDDM in two subpopulations of BB rats (BB/OK and BB/PhiK) by crossing studies with the production of (diabetic BB x LEW 1.A) F1, F2 generations and of first backcross hybrids onto BB (B1BB) and LEW.1A (B1A) rats respectively.
LRRK2 selectively interacts with three Beta-tubulin isoforms: TUBB, TUBB4, and TUBB6, one of which (TUBB4) is mutated in the movement disorder dystonia type 4 (DYT4).
In this study, we aimed to analyze pairwise interactions that are associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) between SNPs from twelve genes robustly associated with obesity (BDNF, ETV5, FAIM2, FTO, GNPDA2, KCTD15, MC4R, MTCH2, NEGR1, SEC16B, SH2B1, and TMEM18).
In total, 15 loci reached genome-wide significance (P-value &lt; 5 x 10(-8)) in the joint discovery and replication analysis, of which 12 are previously identified loci in or close to ADCY3, GNPDA2, TMEM18, SEC16B, FAIM2, FTO, TFAP2B, TNNI3K, MC4R, GPR61, LMX1B and OLFM4 associated with adult body mass index or childhood obesity.
An obesity-related gene, Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 (FAIM2), is regulated by nutritional state and the methylation levels of the FAIM2 promoter are significantly associated with obesity.
Whether the molecular mechanisms by which FAIM2 affects obesity are involved in lifestyle is unclear.
Our results suggest that lifestyle may possibly be mediating the process of the FAIM2 involved in obesity.
Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 (FAIM2) is an obesity-related gene, but the mechanisms by which FAIM2 is involved in obesity are not understood.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential associations of FAIM2 promoter methylation with obesity and components of dyslipidaemia in Chinese children.
This study provides the first evidence that the methylation levels of the FAIM2 promoter are significantly associated with obesity and are independently associated with dyslipidaemia and its components in Chinese children.
The association of FTO rs9939609-A, MC4R rs17782313-C, GNPDA2 rs10938397-G, and FAIM2 rs7138803-A with higher BMI, fat mass percentage, waist circumference, and waist-to height ratio and risk of obesity, and BDNF rs6265-G allele may increase BMI and obesity risk in Chinese children.
Here we aim to see whether variants in obesity-associated genes--NEGR1, FTO, MTCH2, MC4R, LRRN6C, MAP2K5, FAIM2, SEC16B, ETV5, BDNF-AS, ATXN2L, ATP2A1, KCTD15, and TNN13K--are associated with white matter microstructural properties, assessed by high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) in young healthy adults between 20 and 30 years of age from the Queensland Twin Imaging study (QTIM).
Our results reflect an epigenetic regulation of Rbl2/p130 expression in breast cancer.
This highlights the importance of Rbl2/p130 promoter methylation in breast cancer pathogenesis.
Here, we report that ER-beta and pRb2/p130 proteins co-immunoprecipitate in both nucleus and cytoplasm of MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
Here we show a new molecular mechanism of ER-alpha gene inactivation mediated by pRb2/p130 in ER-negative breast cancer cells.
These findings suggest that pRb2/p130-multimolecular complexes can be key elements in the regulation of ER-alpha gene expression and may be viewed as promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of breast cancer, especially for those tumors that are ER negative.
In order to further analyze the role of CEACAM1 in the development of breast cancer, we performed Western-blot analysis and immunohistochemistry with highly specific monoclonal antibodies in a cohort of 68 mammary carcinomas which had also been analyzed for expression of cell-cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1, cyclin E, p16, p21, p27, Rb, and Rb2, as well as for steroid hormone receptor status, Ki67, and HER2/neu immunoreactivity.
Weak or absent Rb2 expression was more often found in endometrial (59%) than in mammary carcinomas (24%).
We found significant positive correlations of Rb2 expression with Rb, ER, and PR-B in breast cancer samples, and of Rb2 with Rb, PR-A, PR-B, and younger age in endometrial carcinomas.
Our results indicate that loss of Rb2 expression, mostly by transcriptional down-regulation, may be associated with the development and dedifferentiation of most endometrial and a subset of mammary carcinomas.
We have developed a novel glycocancer biomarker, fucosylated haptoglobin (Fuc-Hpt), and have investigated its usefulness for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer over approximately 10 years.
In this review, we provide a historical summary of our research on Fuc-Hpt as a cancer biomarker, and discuss a potential early detection system for pancreatic cancer.
We developed a lectin-antibody ELISA kit using PhoSL to determine core-Fuc-Hpt levels in sera from colorectal or pancreatic cancer patients.
Serum levels of AAL-reactive Hpt are higher in pancreatic cancer patients, whereas those of PhoSL-reactive Hpt are higher in colorectal cancer patients.
Fucosylated haptoglobin (Fuc-Hpt) has been identified as a novel biomarker for pancreatic cancer.
We previously found that the level of Fuc-Hpt is increased in the sera of patients with pancreatic cancer, and established a lectin antibody ELISA using Aleuria aurantia lectin, which specifically binds to fucosylated residues on oligosaccharides.
Using the model checking method, we verified several Alzheimer's disease and cancer-related properties, and also identified important proteins (NFKB, ATF4, ASK1 and TRAF2) in the ER-Golgi network, which might be responsible for the pathogenesis of cancer and AD.
We genotyped 107 AIH-1 children and up to 326 healthy subjects for TNFA G-308A, TNFA G-238A, LTA A+252G, LTA A+80C, NFKBIL1 T-63A, BAT1 C-348T, BAT1 G-22C, MICA, and HLA-B polymorphisms.
Tandem repeats of a novel, putative, zinc-binding motif (MYM) have been described within the products of two, highly homologous genes: ZNF198/RAMP/FIM and ZNF261/DXS6673E.
From 2005 to 2010, our unit performed testing for IL2RG, JAK3, IL7R, RAG1, RAG2, DCLRE1C, LIG4, AK2, and ZAP70 mutations in 42 Chinese and Southeast Asian infants with SCID adopting a candidate gene approach, based on patient's gender, immune phenotype, and inheritance pattern.
Mutations were identified in 26 patients, including IL2RG (n = 19), IL7R (n = 2), JAK3 (n = 2), RAG1 (n = 1), RAG2 (n = 1), and DCLRE1C (n = 1).
Mutations in any of eight known genes: IL2RG, ARTEMIS, RAG1, RAG2, ADA, CD45, JAK3, and IL7R cause SCID.
Previous studies have reported that Nit2, a member of the nitrilase superfamily, is a potential tumor suppressor, although its function remains elusive in colon cancer.
In the present study, we employed an RNA interference lentivirus system to silence endogenous NIT2 expression in the colon cancer cell line, HCT116.
The depletion of NIT2 markedly inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation and colony formation and induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, as shown by MTT assay, colony formation assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively.
Further investigation with an intracellular signaling array demonstrated that the depletion of NIT2 triggered the apoptosis of colon cancer cells through the caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) pathways.
Our findings suggest that NIT2 may be an oncogene in human colon cancer and may thus serve as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of colon cancer.
Our report may provide clues regarding the nature of the biological amidase substrate(s) of Nit1 (another member of the Nit family), which is a well-established tumor suppressor protein), and emphasizes a) the crucial role of Nit2 in nitrogen and sulfur metabolism, and b) the possible link of Nit2 to cancer biology.
The purpose of this study was to retrospectively characterize benign and malignant prostate peripheral zone tissue by using endorectal MRI and 3D 1H MRS. Fifty-two men with untreated biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent combined endorectal MRI and MRSI.
The addition of 3D1H MRSI to MRI can improve diagnosis of prostate cancer contributing indirectly to improve local staging.
In addition, the correlation between metabolic 3D1H MRSI data with pathological Gleason grade may offer a non-invasive means to better predict prostate cancer aggressiveness.
The objective of our study was to establish the sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer detection using a combined 1H MR spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted MRI approach.
MRI, dynamic MRI, and 1H-MR spectroscopic imaging were performed in 10 patients with prostate cancer on 1.5T and 3T whole-body scanners.
Initial results of endorectal 3T 1H-MR spectroscopic imaging in prostate cancer patients showed potential advantages: the increase in spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution at higher field strength may result in an improved accuracy in delineating and staging prostate cancer.
To establish an experimental setting for monitoring perfusion and metabolism in orthotopic prostate cancer at 1.5 T using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI) and 1H-MR spectroscopy (MRS).
DCE MRI and 1H-MRS has potential to characterize orthotopic Dunning prostate cancer in rats, which is a promising model similar to human prostate carcinomas.
We recently characterized a stress and glucocorticoid-regulated gene, down-regulated in renal cell carcinoma - DRR1 (Fam107A).
TU3A, located on 3p21.1, was originally identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
In our search for tumor suppressor genes from this region, we have cloned a gene that we have called DRR 1 (downregulated in renal cell carcinoma).
Our results suggest that loss of expression of the DRR 1 gene may play an important role in the development of renal cell carcinoma and possibly other tumors.
E2F5 was identified as one of the most deregulated genes in prostate cancer tissues, predominantly in samples with Gleason-score 6.
Function of E2F5 and p38 in prostate cancer was investigated using siRNA-treatment of PC3 cell-line followed by analyses of associated components and cell cycle.
Our findings unearthed that E2F5/p38 axis played a cardinal role in uncontrolled cellular proliferation in prostate cancer through pSMAD3L activation.
It also underscores a strong potential for E2F5 to be incorporated as a tool in early detection of prostate cancer.
We report the coexistence of otitis media and epididymo-orchitis owing to Hemophilus influenzae, type b in 2 children.
Overexpression of tau rescued the Nogo-66-induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma 2a (N2a) cells and primary cortical neurons.
Taken together, we suggest that Nogo-A is closely involved in the neuronal response to hypoxic and oxidative stress, an observation that may be of relevance not only in stroke-induced ischaemia, but also in neuroblastoma formation.
In the present study, we report on the role of GSK-3Beta signaling on Nogo-66-treated mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor stimulates the phosphorylation, suppressing Nogo-dependent inhibition of neurite outgrowth from neuroblastoma-derived neural cells.
In our per-SNP analysis, eight myopia gene associations were replicated successfully: GJD2, RASGRF1, BICC1, KCNQ5, CD55, CYP26A1, LRRC4C, and B4GALNT2.Seven additional gene associations were replicated in our gene-based analyses: GRIA4, BMP2, QKI, BMP4, SFRP1, SH3GL2, and EHBP1L1.
The aims of the present study were to immunohistochemically examine S100A10 expression in surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas, and evaluate any relationships with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of patients.
S100A10 expression was immunohistochemically studied in 202 consecutive resected lung adenocarcinomas, and its associations with clinicopathological parameters were evaluated.
S100A10 expression was detected in 65 of the 202 (32.2%) lung adenocarcinomas, being significantly correlated with poorer differentiation (P =0.015), a higher pathological TNM stage (stages II and III) (P=0.004), more frequent and severe intratumoral vascular invasion (P=0.001), and a poorer prognosis (P=0.030).
The present study reveals that S100A10 is expressed in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas, and this is related to some clinicopathological parameters, although further studies are required to confirm the correlation between S100A10 expression and prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients.
Using mass spectrometry for protein identification and validating the results by immunohistochemistry on an independent validation set, we could identify two of 60 differentially expressed m/z species between Barrett's adenocarcinoma and the precursor lesion: COX7A2 and S100-A10.
In the validation set, we found a correlation of the expression levels of COX7A2 and TAGLN2 with a poor prognosis while S100-A10 was confirmed by multivariate analysis as a novel independent prognostic factor in Barrett's adenocarcinoma.
S100A10, a member of the S100 family, forms a heterotetramer with annexin IIH and promotes carcinoma invasion and metastasis by plasminogen activation.
Cells stained positively in 14.6% and 20.8% of follicular carcinomas for S100A10 and annexin II, respectively, but their expression levels were always low.
S100A10 and annexin II were expressed in all papillary carcinomas, but 88.2% and 82.8% ofpapillary carcinomas were classified in the low group.
These findings suggest that S100A10 and annexin II contribute to the aggressive characteristics of anaplastic carcinoma, while playing a constitutive role in papillary carcinoma.
The spin-labeled derivative of podophyllotoxin, N'-podophyllic acid-N-[3-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl pyrrolinenyloxy)] semicarbazide (GP-11), was synthesized and tested for its antitumor activity against mouse transplantable tumors, Sarcoma-180, Hepatoma-A, P388 leukemia and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma.
Remote parenchymal hemorrhage (rPH) after intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator may be associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, although supportive data are limited.
We here review the data with respect to the activation of tPA by fibrin and its multiple other cofactors, in relation to tPA's role in pathophysiology, notably fibrinolysis and amyloidosis, with emphasis on Alzheimer's disease.
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) may be an important predisposing factor for the hemorrhagic complications of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) therapy.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of intranasal immunization with non-ionic surfactant vesicles (NISV) containing either the secretory recombinant form of glycoprotein B (gBs) of herpes simplex virus type 1 or a related polylysine reach peptides (DTK) for induction of protective immunity against genital herpes infection in mice.
Seventeen molecules, including transcription factor E2F, T-cell-specific transcription factor, Src (known as "proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase of sarcoma"), interferon regulatory factor 1, thymidylate synthase, cyclin B, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4, CDK, caspase-1, vitamin D receptor, histone deacetylase, MAPK/ERK kinase, bcl-2-associated X protein, runt-related transcription factor 1, PR domain zinc finger protein 1, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and interleukin 1, were identified as candidate molecules.
The IRF-1 priming of TEXs enhances antitumour immune response.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication, 7 November 2017; doi:10.1038/bjc.2017.389 www.bjcancer.com.
Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) has been suggested to act as a tumor suppressor in human cancers.
However, the clinical significance and biological function of IRF1 in cholangiocarcinoma is poorly understood.
In our results, IRF1 mRNA and protein expressions were decreased in cholangiocarcinoma tissues and cell lines compared with paired normal hepatic tissues and intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cell line.
IRF1 protein low-expression was associated with tumor stage, tumor size, vascular invasion and metastasis and served as a poor independent prognostic parameter in cholangiocarcinoma patients.
Up-regulation of IRF1 expression suppressed cholangiocarcinoma cells proliferation, migration and invasion, and blocked cell cycle progression, but has no effect on apoptosis.
In conclusion, IRF1 is low-expressed in cholangiocarcinoma tissues and cell lines, and correlated with malignant status and prognosis in cholangiocarcinoma patients.
IRF1 served as tumor suppressor in the regulation of cholangiocarcinoma cells proliferation, cell cycle, migration and invasion.
To examine genetic defects of the IFNGamma-IRF1 pathway in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma (LuAd) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LuSc) data.
IRF1 expression was correlated with immune cytolytic activity markers GZMA and PRF1 in NSCLC.
Deletion of JAK2 or inhibition of the JAK2 kinase activity resulted in loss of IFNGamma-induced IRF1 and cell surface HLA-ABC in JAK2 wildtype NSCLC cells, whereas expression of exogenous JAK2 in H1573 cells restored the IFNGamma responses.
These findings show that JAK2 deficiency is the major mechanism of genetic defects of the IFNGamma-IRF1 pathway in NSCLC and reveal a previously unrecognized significance of chromosome 9p deletion in NSCLC.
Performance of the investigational use only-labeled GeneXpert(R) (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) Bladder Cancer Assay, an assay for detection of the five mRNAs (ABL1, CRH, IGF2, ANXA10, and UPK1B), was evaluated in an independent test cohort (n=450).
Our previous mass spectrometry-based proteomics study revealed that annexin A10 (ANXA10) was uniquely overexpressed in pancreatic CD24+ adenocarcinoma cells that were dissected from clinical PDAC tissues but was absent in CD24- adjacent normal cells.
The correlation between ANXA10 expression and the progression of pancreatic cancer remains unknown.
In this study, we performed an immunostaining assay to evaluate ANXA10 expression in 155 primary human tissue specimens, including normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis (CP), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN, the most important precursor of PDAC), and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).
Since PDAC develops through a series of PanINs which in turn arise from pancreatic ducts, the consistent overexpression of ANXA10 in ductal epithelial cells in PanINs and PDACs but negative in normal pancreatic ducts suggests that ANXA10 could serve as a potential marker indicating the presence of PDAC at its earliest precancerous stages.
In this study, we evaluated the effects of simvastatin on ANXA10 signaling in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.
In human prostate biopsy samples, ANXA10 mRNA expression was significantly lower in the prostate cancer group than in the BPH group.
Next, we found that up-regulation of ANXA10 in PC-3 resulted in down-regulation of S100 calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4), which is reportedly correlated with aggressiveness and a worse prognosis for patients with different types of carcinomas.
Our results suggest that statins inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by up-regulation of ANXA10.
Immunohistochemistry for 7 gastric-type markers (ANXA10, VSIG1, CLDN18, CTSE, TFF2, MUC5AC, and MUC6) and 2 intestinal-type markers (CDX2 and CK20) was performed in 36 normal gastric/colorectal mucosa tissues, 163 colorectal polyps, and 175 microsatellite-unstable colorectal carcinomas (MSI-H CRCs).
Two decades ago, Galectin-8 was described as a prostate carcinoma biomarker since it is only expressed in the neoplastic prostate, but not in the healthy tissue.
In this study we silenced Galectin-8 in two human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and IGR-CaP1, and designed a pre-clinical experimental model that allows monitoring the pathology from its early steps to the long-term metastatic stages.
We show for the first time that the natural and conserved expression of Gal-8 in tumour cells is responsible for the metastatic evolution of prostate cancer.
Collectively, our results highlight Galectin-8 as a potential target for anti-metastatic therapy against prostate cancer.
Immunocytochemistry for prostate carcinoma tumour antigen (PCTA-1) was performed for culture purity evaluation.
Galectin-8 levels of expression positively correlate with certain human neoplasms, prostate cancer being the best example studied thus far.
The Prostate Carcinoma Tumor Antigen-1 (PCTA-1) is located at the prostate cancer susceptibility locus on chromosome 1q42.2-43 (PCaP).
Seventy-seven familial prostate cancer cases from 36 German and French pedigrees were screened for germline mutations in the PCTA-1 gene using enzymatic mutation detection (EMD).
PCTA-1 is not a classical high risk gene with deleterious mutations predisposing to hereditary prostate cancer.
The isolation of Prostate Carcinoma Tumor Antigen-1 (PCTA-1), a cDNA closely related to rat and human Galectin-8, as a surface marker associated with prostate cancer was achieved using a previously described immunological subtraction approach, Surface Epitope Masking (SEM) approach, in combination with expression screening.
PCTA-1 maps to 1q42-43, a locus associated with predisposition to prostate cancer.
Screening a human LNCaP prostate cancer cDNA expression library with the Pro 1.5 mAb identifies a gene, prostate carcinoma tumor antigen-1 (PCTA-1).
Primer pairs within the 3' untranslated region of PCTA-1 and reverse transcription-PCR demonstrate selective expression of PCTA-1 by prostate carcinomas versus normal prostate and benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Moreover, Foxp3 could interact with LMO2 and affect the expression level of TAL1, which was in accordance with the findings in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Overexpression of LMO2 is known to be one of the causes of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) development; however, the mechanisms behind its oncogenic activity are incompletely understood.
Expression of LMO2 has been evaluated in B-cell lymphoma, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia; however, information concerning its role in breakpoint cluster region/Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (BCR/ABL) negative B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains limited.
Oncogenic transcription factors are commonly activated in acute leukemias and subvert normal gene expression networks to reprogram hematopoietic progenitors into preleukemic stem cells, as exemplified by LIM-only 2 (LMO2) in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) frequently involves aberrant expression of TAL1 (T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1) and LMO2, oncogenic members of the TAL1 transcriptional complex.
Lmo2 is an oncogenic transcription factor that is frequently overexpressed in T-cell acute leukemias, in particular poor prognosis early T-cell precursor-like (ETP-) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Participants (N = 4,901) were from Look AHEAD, a randomized controlled trial that compared ILI to diabetes support and education (DSE).
A multidomain intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) to induce weight loss and increase physical activity for 8 to 11 years or diabetes support and education (DSE), a control condition.
Overweight and obese (BMI &gt;=25 kg/m 2) middle-aged and older adults (aged 45-76 years at enrollment) with type 2 diabetes enrolled in Look AHEAD, a trial evaluating an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) designed to achieve weight loss through caloric restriction and increased physical activity compared to diabetes support and education (DSE), underwent standardized assessments of performance-based physical function including a 4- and 400-m walk, lower extremity physical performance (expanded Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPBexp), and grip strength approximately 11 years post-randomization and 1.5 years after the intervention was stopped (n=3,783).
To address the unique nature of prions, our group targets epitopes, termed disease specific epitopes (DSEs), whose exposure for antibody binding depends on disease-associated misfolding of PrPC into PrPSc.
During 5 years spanning the end of intervention and post-intervention follow-up, repeated cognitive assessments were obtained in 1,091 individuals who had been assigned to ILI or a control condition of diabetes support and education (DSE).
A total of 5145 persons aged 45 to 76 years with DM were randomized to either an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) with reduced calorie consumption and increased physical activity designed to achieve and maintain &gt;=7% weight loss or to diabetes support and education intervention (DSE).
The purpose of this study was to assess range of motion (ROM), pain, and incidence of radiographic degenerative joint disease (DJD) after volar radioscapholunate (RSL) arthrodesis and distal scaphoidectomy (DSE) following malunited distal radius fractures (DRF).
Fourteen patients with malunited DRF and DJD limited to the radiocarpal joint underwent RSL arthrodesis and DSE between 2006 and 2014.
The impact of a static electric field (EF) on amyloid peptide aggregation has been much less studied, although EFs may have some applications to treat Parkinson's disease symptoms.
Cognitive impairments occur frequently and early in multiple sclerosis (MS) and contribute significantly to a reduced quality of life of patients with MS. Executive functions (EFs) play a pivotal role for the behavioral adaption to the environment and are also crucial for compensatory processes of cognitive impairments.
Several recent studies have pointed out that early impairment of executive functions (EFs) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) may be a crucial marker to detect patients at risk for developing dementia.
Importantly, analysis of circulating EVs from plasma of alcoholic hepatitis patients revealed increased numbers of EVs that contained high levels of miR-27a as compared with healthy controls.
The following associations were found: auto-immune thyroid disease (4.3% of DH patients and 6.0% of CD patients), insulin dependent diabetes (1.0% DH and 5.5% CD), lupus erythematosus (1.3% DH and 0.3% CD), Sjoegren's syndrome (1.0% DH and 2.9% CD), sarcoidosis (1.3% DH and 1.8% CD), and vitiligo or alopecia areata (1.6% DH and 0% CD).
Rarely, an association of parkinsonism with PN may be encountered in other neurodegenerative diseases such as fragile X-associated tremor and ataxia syndrome related to premutation CGG repeat expansion in the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene, Machado-Joseph disease related to an abnormal CAG repeat expansion in ataxin-3 (ATXN3) gene, Kufor-Rakeb syndrome caused by mutations in ATP13A2 gene, or in hereditary systemic disorders such as Gaucher disease due to mutations in the Beta-glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene and Chediak-Higashi syndrome due to LYST gene mutations.
We also identified the mutation of the LYST gene, that is causative gene for Chediak-Higashi syndrome, for the autosomal recessive complicated spastic paraplegia with cerebellar ataxia and neuropathy.
To our knowledge, this is the first study on spina bifida to determine the nucleotide sequences of breakpoints for trisomy 2p24.3-pter and monosomy 5p14.3-pter.
Our report serves to emphasize the consistency in the prenatal sonographic feature of spina bifida in consecutive pregnancies with fetuses associated with partial trisomy 3q (3q26.1-qter) and partial monosomy 5p (5p13.33-pter).
These are classified into ten different types (NDNC1-10), which are described in OMIM.1 The genes described for isolated nail disorders include PLCD1 (MIM 602142), RSPO4 (MIM 610573), FZD6 (MIM 603409), COL7A1 (MIM 120120), HPGD (MIM 601688) and SLCO2A1 (MIM 601460).
Anonychia/hyponychia congenita is a rare autosomal recessive developmental disorder characterized by the absence (anonychia) or hypoplasia (hyponuchia) of finger- and/or toenails frequently caused by mutations in the R-spondin 4 (RSPO4) gene.
Because there were no other congenital abnormalities, this was considered to be anonychia congenita; probably caused by a recessive defect of the R-spondin 4-coding gene.
To investigate whether receipt of any antithrombin concentrate improves laboratory and clinical outcomes in children undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory failure during their hospitalization compared with those who did not receive antithrombin.
Intermittent, on-demand dosing of antithrombin concentrate in pediatric patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for respiratory failure increased antithrombin levels, but not typically to the targeted level.
We hypothesized that combining intravenous recombinant human antithrombin (rhAT), nebulized heparin, and nebulized tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) more effectively improves pulmonary gas exchange compared with a single rhAT infusion, while maintaining the anti-inflammatory properties of rhAT in ARDS.
After 12 months, bonds fell from 43.9 +/- 9.5 MPa to 20.1 +/- 5.4 MPa and from 39.6 +/- 9.4 MPa to 14.2 +/- 5.0 MPa in control specimens for SB1 and XPB respectively, while bond fell only from 41.9 +/- 9.6MPa to 33.2 +/- 8.3 MPa and 38.3 +/- 8.9 MPa to 26.5 +/- 10.9 (for SB1 and XPB, respectively) when 0.2% CHX was previously used.
Primary SFs from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were treated with recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 or transduced with a constitutively active mutant of the ALK3 gene (ALK3CA) with or without TNF-Alfa, and then cultured in pellets.
We describe a patient with ALK-negative ALCL presenting with clinical and radiographic findings suggesting osteomyelitis 6 months after left rotator cuff repair surgery.
We compared levels of GABA(B) receptor subunits GABA(B) receptor 1 (GABBR1) and GABA(B) receptor 2 (GABBR2) in cerebellum, Brodmann's area 9 (BA9), and BA40 of subjects with autism and matched controls.
Sclerosteosis is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the SOST gene which encodes a secreted glycoprotein, sclerostin.
VBD is caused by a noncoding deletion that removes a SOST-specific regulatory element in bone.
Here we describe how human genetics studies in sclerosteosis and VBD patients, in combination with the generation of transgenic and knockout mice, has led to a better understanding of the role of sclerostin in bone metabolism.
In addition, expression of SOST is delayed or suppressed; resulting in active WNT signaling and enhanced periosteal bone formation, and the combined outcome is generalized hyperostosis.
Initially, we and others reported that sclerosteosis was caused by loss-of-function mutations in SOST, encoding sclerostin.
More recently, we identified disease-causing mutations in LRP4, a binding partner of sclerostin, in three sclerosteosis patients.
The positive correlation we found between sclerostin and age in Paget disease of bone patients indicates that in comparative studies, sclerostin serum levels must be adjusted for age.
Sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease are two rare bone sclerosing dysplasias caused by genetic defects in the synthesis of sclerostin.
In this article we review the demographic, clinical, biochemical, radiological, and histological characteristics of patients with sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease that led to a better understanding of the role of sclerostin in bone metabolism in humans and we discuss the relevance of these findings for the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of patients with osteoporosis.
After discovering that lack of Sost/sclerostin expression is the cause of the high bone mass human syndromes Van Buchem disease and sclerosteosis, extensive animal experimentation and clinical studies demonstrated that sclerostin plays a critical role in bone homeostasis and that its deficiency or pharmacological neutralization increases bone formation.
Loss-of-function mutations of the sclerostin gene (SOST) cause sclerosteosis and Van Buchem disease characterized by bone overgrowth.
Mutations in the human sclerostin gene (SOST) lead to sclerosteosis with progressive skeletal overgrowth, whereas sclerostin-deficient (Sost(-/-)) mice exhibit increased bone mass and strength.
Therefore, this study provides additional support to develop OGA inhibitors as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative tauopathies.
To identify the association between gastrointestinal carcinomas (GIC) risk and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) 1A7 polymorphisms through a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
In this study, the expression and regulation of two androgen-inactivating enzymes, the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, was assessed in breast cancer.
Global ablation of INSL3 hormone or its receptor RXFP2 in male mice results in cryptorchidism and infertility.
We have also produced shRNA transgenic mice with reduced RXFP2 expression Such males manifested various degree of uni- and bilateral cryptorchidism.
To study the consequences of an aberrant testicular environment in cryptorchidism we used a mouse model with a deletion of Rxfp2 gene resulting in a high intra-abdominal testicular position.
Deletion of Insl3 or Rxfp2 genes in mice caused cryptorchidism resulting from a failure of gubernaculum development.
Using Cre transgene driven by retinoic acid receptor beta promoter, conditional gene targeting in gubernacular mesenchymal cells at early embryonic stages caused high intraabdominal cryptorchidism as in males with a global deletion of Rxfp2.
Prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol affected the expression of LGR8 mRNA in the mouse gubernaculum testis, which suggests that diethylstilbestrol may induce cryptorchidism by interfering with the INSL3-LGR8 signaling system and consequently the development of the gubernaculum testis.
Prospectively collected cremaster muscle and/or hernia sac tissues from boys with congenital (79) or acquired (66) nonsyndromic cryptorchidism and hernia/hydrocele (controls, 84) were analyzed for hormone receptor (RXFP2, AR, ESR1, ESR2) and myosin heavy chain specific (MYH1, MYH2, MYH7) mRNA expression using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Exon sequencing of candidate genes identified mutations in mice with cystic kidneys (Bicc1), cryptorchidism (Rxfp2), restricted germ cell deficiency (Plk4), and severe germ cell deficiency (Prdm9).
Patients with definite pneumonia at the time of admission, those with left-sided heart failure, pulmonary embolism and an identifiable cause of acute lung injury, and those whose albumin or C-reactive protein levels were not measured were excluded.
Analyzing gene expression signatures in endometrial and stomach adenocarcinomas revealed that tumors with a JAK1 frameshift exhibited reduced expression of interferon response signatures and multiple anti-tumor immune signatures.
From these data, we derive two primary conclusions: 1) JAK1 frameshifts are loss of function alterations that represent a potential pan-cancer adaptation to immune responses against tumors with microsatellite instability; 2) The mechanism by which JAK1 loss of function contributes to tumor immune evasion is likely associated with loss of the JAK1-mediated interferon response.
MAJIC (ISRCTN61925716) is a randomized phase 2 trial of ruxolitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor) vs best available therapy (BAT) in ET and polycythemia vera patients resistant or intolerant to HC.
Ruxolitinib (Rux), a JAK1/2 inhibitor, has been approved for patients with myelofibrosis and in polycythemia vera with inadequate response/intolerance to hydroxycarbamide.
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by episodic yet cumulative heterotopic ossification (HO) in skeletal muscles, tendons, and ligaments over a patient's lifetime.
Gain-of-function mutations in the Type I Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) receptor ACVR1 have been identified in two diseases: Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP), a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by genetically driven heterotopic ossification, and in 20-25% of Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPGs), a pediatric brain tumor with no effective therapies and dismal median survival.
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is an autosomal dominant disorder due to germline mutations of ACVR1/ALK2 causing progressive heterotopic endochondral ossifications.
It is an autosomal dominant disease, usually caused by a new mutation in the ACVR1 receptor gene, which is in the signaling pathway for bone morphogenic protein.
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), characterized by congenital malformation of bones, is an autosomal dominant disorder.
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification in skeletal muscle tissue.
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification.
Loss of ORAI1 function is linked with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and hence pharmacological blockers of ORAI1 could be potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of RA.
To determine whether Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels contribute to the abnormal behaviour of T cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we performed a cross-sectional study to characterize the expression and functional status of CRACM1 channels in RA patients.
Since autoreactive T cells play an important role in the development of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and organ transplantation, Orai1 becomes an attractive therapeutic target for ameliorating autoimmune disease.
Our results demonstrate that a few point mutations in the Lol p 5 sequence yield mutants with reduced allergenic activity that represent potential vaccine candidates for immunotherapy of grass pollen allergy.
Herein we present data relative to the effect of knocking down BCKDK gene on the real time oxygen consumption rate of fibroblasts obtained from a Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) patient.
Data relative to the effectiveness of the knockdown together with the potentiality of the BCKDK-knockdown to increase the deficient branched-chain Alfa-ketoacid dehydrogenase activity detected in MSUD patients are also shown.
In the study, 800 patients with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral artery disease (PAD) or multiple cardiovascular risk factors (MRF) were recruited.
To obtain Western European perspectives on the economic burden of atherothrombosis in patients with multiple risk factors only (MRF), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and in the under-evaluated group of patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), we examined vascular-related hospitalisation rates and associated costs in France and Germany.
The stroke relationships of a Chinese character reflect its structure, which can be statistically represented by the neighborhood system and clique potentials within the MRF framework.
We penalize the structurally mismatched stroke relationships with MRFs using the prior clique potentials, and derive the likelihood clique potentials from Gaussian mixture models, which encode the large variations of stroke relationships statistically.
In the proposed HCCR system, we use the single-site likelihood clique potentials to extract many candidate strokes from character images, and use the pairsite clique potentials to determine the best structural match between the input candidate strokes and the MRF-based character models by relaxation labeling.
Total left ventricular stroke volume (TSV), antegrade stroke volume (ASV), and mitral regurgitation volume (MRV) and fraction (MRF) were determined and compared between the two modalities.
The reliability of non-invasive quantification of mitral regurgitation (MR) was assessed in 76 patients with angiographically demonstrated MR by comparing the results of different echo-Doppler (ED) indices with angiographic grade and MR fraction (MRF).
Allergic asthma from mint is less well-recognized.
A case of a 54-year-old woman with dyspnea on exposure to the scent of peppermint is presented in whom mint exposure, as seemingly innocuous as the breath of others who had consumed Tic Tac candies, exacerbated her underlying asthma.
Additionally, this cases suggests that asthma can result from inhaling the scent of mint and gives consideration to obtaining confirmatory pre- and postexposure pulmonary function data by both impulse oscillometry and spirometry.
We review the significance of elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels and discuss the clinical relevance of this unusual presentation of a possible primary Hodgkin's lymphoma.
However, we have found that exogenous 8-OHdG can paradoxically reduce ROS production, attenuate the nuclear factor-KB signaling pathway, and ameliorate the expression of proinflammatory mediators such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, cyclo-oxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase in addition to expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NOX)-1, NOX organizer-1 and NOX activator-1 in various conditions of inflammation-based gastrointestinal (GI) diseases including gastritis, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, and even colitis-associated carcinogenesis.
We studied nine patients (56 +/- 7 years) with complete AV-block and permanent dual-chamber pacemaker (DDD) under different pacing modes: ventricle pacing (VVI) 70 bpm, DDD 106 +/- 4 bpm, rate adaptive pacing (VVI-FA) 108 +/- 3 bpm.
Recently, several reports have demonstrated that dysregulation of miR-4262 is in numerous cancers.
Overexpression of miR-4262 was demonstrated to decrease GALNT4 mRNA and protein expression levels, and thereby suppressed cell viability, growth and cell-cycle progression in SW480 and SW620 colon cancer cells.
The expression level of miR-4262 was observed to be downregulated as the expression of GALNT4 was upregulated in colon cancer tissues and cell lines.
In conclusion, the results demonstrated that miR-4262 may be involved in the development of colon cancer via targeting of GALNT4.
The miR-4262/GALNT4 axis may be a novel target for diagnosing and understanding the underlying molecular mechanism of colon cancer.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether miR-4262 was associated with the prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients.
In this study, we investigated the role and underlying mechanism of miR-4262 in the proliferation of human cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) cells.
The expression levels of miR-4262 were significantly upregulated in cancerous tissues compared with those in matched adjacent normal tissues from 110 CMM patients.
miR-4262 was also regulated in five types of CMM cell lines, displaying an opposite expression pattern to that of Kruppel-like 6 (KLF6), a proven tumor suppressor in several cancers other than CMM.
miR-4262 is a potential tumor promoter in human cancers.
In this study, we first investigated the role of miR-4262 in the proliferation and invasion of human breast cancer cells.
Our results showed that, compared with the adjacent tissues and MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells, miR-4262 was markedly increased in the breast cancer tissues and five cell lines, including MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-435, SKBR3, and MCF-7.
Then the miR-4262 mimic or oligo anta-miR-4262 was transfected into MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines.
In conclusion, miR-4262 positively regulates proliferation and invasion of human breast cancer cells via suppression of KLF6 and KLF15.
Together, our data suggest that suppression of miR-4262 in OS cells may promote OPN-mediated cancer invasion, highlighting miR-4262 as an intriguing therapeutic target to prevent OS metastases.
Those can be classified into four groups: hypercalciuric hypomagnesemias (encompassing mutations in CLDN16, CLDN19, CASR, CLCNKB), Gitelman-like hypomagnesemias (CLCNKB, SLC12A3, BSND, KCNJ10, FYXD2, HNF1B, PCBD1), mitochondrial hypomagnesemias (SARS2, MT-TI, Kearns-Sayre syndrome) and other hypomagnesemias (TRPM6, CNMM2, EGF, EGFR, KCNA1, FAM111A).
For radiculopathy, epidural corticosteroids were associated with greater immediate-term reduction in pain (weighted mean difference on a scale of 0 to 100, -7.55 [95% CI, -11.4 to -3.74]; SOE, moderate), function (standardized mean difference after exclusion of an outlier trial, -0.33 [CI, -0.56 to -0.09]; SOE, low), and short-term surgery risk (relative risk, 0.62 [CI, 0.41 to 0.92]; SOE, low).
The final multilevel growth model revealed improvements in RMDQ scores in patients with radiculopathy at the 6-week (-8.1, 95 % CI -12.6 to -2.6; P = 0.006) and 6-month (-4.1, 95 % CI -7.4 to -0.7; P = 0.020) follow-up occasions compared to patients without radiculopathy.
An interaction between electrodiagnostic status and time revealed faster weekly improvements in RMDQ scores in patients with radiculopathy at the 6-week (-0.72, 95 % CI -1.4 to -0.04; P = 0.040) through the 16-week (-0.30, 95 % CI, -0.57 to -0.04; P = 0.028) follow-up occasions compared to patients without radiculopathy.
For patients with radiculopathy, a repeated-measures analysis of variance showed a significant decrease in the H reflex amplitude (from 0.81 +/- 0.4 to 0.69 +/- 0.39 mV), an increase in radicular symptoms after reading (from 4.2 +/- 1.3 to 5.6 +/- 1.4 on the visual analog scale), an increase in the H reflex amplitude (from 0.69 +/- 0.39 to 1.01 +/- 0.49 mV), and a decrease in pain intensity (from 5.6 +/- 1.4 to 1.5 +/- 1.3) after repeated neck retractions.
Although some autoinflammatory diseases are due to gain-of-function mutations for caspase-1 activity, common diseases such as gout, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, recurrent pericarditis, rheumatoid arthritis, and smoldering myeloma also are responsive to IL-1Beta neutralization.
Inactivation of Ccl2 in an Lkb1-driven mouse model of endometrial cancer slowed tumor progression and increased survival.
In human primary endometrial cancers, loss of LKB1 protein was strongly associated with increased CCL2 expression by tumor cells as well as increased macrophage density in the tumor microenvironment.
These data demonstrate that CCL2 is a potent effector of LKB1 loss in endometrial cancer, creating potential avenues for therapeutic opportunities.
Our results showed that in HEC-1-B (human endometrial cancer) cells, IL-17 stimulation induced mRNA level increases of CCL2, CCL5, CCL20, CXCL2, and IL-8.
In this study of Turkish women, the association of CCL2 A2518G and CCR2 V64I polymorphisms with endometrial cancer was investigated using 50 endometrial cancer patients and 211 controls.
In our study, individuals with CCL2 A2518G GG genotype showed a 6.7-fold increased risk for endometrial cancer (p&lt;0.0001) and individuals with CCL2 A2518G A allele had a 7.14-fold lower risk of endometrium cancer (p&lt;0.0001).
In conclusion, we state that there appears to be an association between polymorphism of CCL2 and its receptor CCR2 and endometrial cancer.
A total of 146 cryptorchid and 140 infertile patients without a history of cryptorchidism were screened with a sequence tagged site plus/minus method and further confirmed and characterized by CDY1/DAZ gene dosage and copy analysis.
The aim of this study is to explore the various modes of action miR-497 has on human cervical cancer (CC) cell behavior.
In this study, the expression levels of PVT1 and miR-497 in NSCLC cells were determined by qRT-PCR.
Our findings indicated that PVT1 was significantly upregulated and miR-497 was markedly downregulated in NSCLC cell lines.
Moreover, PVT1 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-497 on cell viability, invasion and promotion effect on apoptosis of NSCLC cells.
In conclusion, knockdown of PVT1 inhibited cell viability, invasion and induced apoptosis in NSCLC by regulating miR-497 expression, elucidating the molecular mechanism of the oncogenic role of PVT1 in NSCLC and providing an lncRNA-directed target for NSCLC.
Many prominent cancer-associated molecules have been identified over the recent years which include EGFR, CD44, TGFbRII, HER2, miR-497, NMP22, BTA, Fibrin/FDP etc.
The expression levels of miR-497 in the cancerous and the adjacent noncancerous tissues were detected using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
An miR-497-overexpressing vector was transfected into the T24 and BIU-87 bladder cancer cell lines in order to determine the effect of miR-497 expression on cell migration and invasion using Transwell assays.
The findings of the present study revealed that miR-497 was expressed at low levels in the cancer bladder tissue compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissue, and its expression was associated with the pathological classification, TNM stage and metastasis.
The present study revealed that miR-497 overexpression may be a suppressor of the metastasis of bladder cancer, and may have an important role in the diagnosis of bladder cancer.
PHR patient portal users (34 percent of eligible persons) were older and more likely to be White, have private health insurance, and develop gestational diabetes than nonusers.
We searched the Internet to review patient-held medical records (PHRs) of patients with diabetes and examine current levels of integration of diabetes and depression care in Japan.
Eight sets of PHRs were found for people with diabetes.
All PHRs included clinical follow-up of diabetes and multidisciplinary clinical pathways for diabetes care.
In terms of an integrated PHR for a patient comorbid with diabetes and depression, necessary components include hopes/preferences, educational information on diabetes complications and treatment, medical history, stress and coping, resources, and monitoring diabetes and depression.
A new PHR may be suitable for comorbid patients with diabetes and depression.
to evaluate the attitude of patients with Type II diabetes towards using a PHR to manage their condition.
The attitude of patients towards using PHR in management of their diabetes was positive.
Personal health records (PHRs) have the potential to improve patient self-management for chronic conditions such as diabetes.
The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore how patients with type 2 diabetes used a PHR to manage their diabetes-related health information for self-care.
Fifty-nine patients with type 2 diabetes were interviewed 3-6 months after receiving initial training on a free-of-charge, Web-based PHR.
The objective of this paper is to describe the design and implementation of a Personal Health Record System (PHR-S) for supporting monitoring of blood glucose in diabetes mellitus type 2 patients.
In this study the different applications and functionalities of the program are demonstrated such as: exhaustive assembly (rDNA region and mitochondrial genome), extracting homologous regions or genes (IGS, RPB1, RPB2 and TEF1a), as well as extracting multiple regions within a single run.
Sequences of the translation elongation factor 1Alfa (tef1Alfa), RNA polymerase II subunit B2 (rpb2), ATP citrate lyase subunit A (acla), and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions were monomorphic, while the intergenic spacer (IGS) region showed length polymorphisms at two minisatellites of 23 and 39 nucleotides (nt).
The phylogenetic relationships of these species were determined using sequences from the ITS and IGS region of the nuclear rRNA gene complex, two nuclear genes ( Beta -tubulin (benA) and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2)) and two mitochondrial genes (small rRNA subunit (rns) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox1)) and, where available, related sequences from databases.
The combined use of the three commonly employed nuclear genes (benA, rpb2, and ITS), the IGS region, and two less often used mitochondrial gene sequences (rns and cox1) as a single unit resolved several taxonomic ambiguities.
In order to find other markers that, in combination with the ITS rDNA region can be used for species identification in Cladonia, we studied the loci IGS rDNA, ef1Alfa, rpb2 and cox1.
Three-gene combined analyses (ITS+IGS+rpb2) were performed and the results indicated that the Chinese 'G.
Seven loci were analyzed: the translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene (EF-1Alfa); the nuclear rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS), large subunit (LSU), and intergenic spacer (IGS) regions; the second largest subunit of the RNA polymerase gene (RPB2); the calmodulin gene (CAM); and the mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU) rRNA gene.
Twenty-nine IGS, 27 EF-1Alfa, 26 RPB2, 24 CAM, 18 ITS, 19 LSU, and 18 mtSSU haplotypes were identified; 29 were unique, and haplotypes for 24 clinical strains were novel.
Complete absence of STAT6 was most common in pleomorphic liposarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma (60% and 72% cases negative, respectively).
Patients with ASC due to choledocholithiasis were allocated to two groups: Those who underwent EST immediately and those who underwent EBD followed by EST 1 wk later because they were under anticoagulant therapy, had a coagulopathy (international normalized ratio &gt; 1.3, partial thromboplastin time greater than twice that of control), or had a platelet count &lt; 50000 x 10(3)/myL.
A cross of the Asd-4 mutant with wild-type resulted in fruiting bodies that appeared to be normal macroscopically but which were complete devoid of asci and ascospores.
A mutant strain (asd-1) with a recessive crossing defect (apparently caused by the RIP process) was isolated; in this strain, early development is normal and may asci are formed, but ascospores are never delineated.
cPGES and mPGES-2 have been found expressed in normal gastric mucosa, with no change in expression levels seen in gastritis or gastric ulcer tissue.
Herein we investigated the ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 signalings in male breast cancer (MBC).
We have previously shown that the1100delC variant of the cell-cycle-checkpoint kinase gene CHEK2, which is carried by approximately 1% of the population confers a two-fold increase in female breast cancer and a 10-fold increase in male breast cancer.
The purpose of present study was to investigate the relation of serum interleukin-19 (IL-19) levels with diabetic nephropathy (DN).
IL-19 is significantly positive correlated with UAE and Cystatin C. IL-19 may play an important role that contributes to the progression of diabetic nephropathy.
We also demonstrate a large increase in levels of IL-19 in urine of patients with chronic kidney disease, which significantly correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate levels.
Non-clustered protocadherins (PCDHs) are calcium-dependent adhesion molecules which have attracted attention for their possible roles in the neuronal circuit formation during development and their implications in the neurological disorders such as autism and mental retardation.
Mutation screening of 30 individuals with autism identified two PCDH11Y polymorphic amino acid changes, F885V and K980N.
In the present study, we analyzed the expression levels of LETM1 in bladder cancer tissues and non-cancerous tissues as well as in four bladder cancer cell lines (T24, EJ, 5637 and J82) and a human bladder epithelial immortalized cell line SV-HUC-1.
The PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression levels were measured in the bladder cancer T24 cell line and the human uroepithelial SV-HUC-1 cell line, following treatment with interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-Alfa and IFN-Gamma, by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively.
RT-qPCR and western blotting demonstrated that cytokines IL-2, IFN-Alfa and IFN-Gamma markedly upregulated PD-L1 mRNA expression rates and protein levels in bladder cancer T24 cells (P&lt;0.05), but had no significant effect in non-tumor SV-HUC-1 cells.
Our data showed that miR-6838 was sharply up-regulated in the bladder tissues from bladder cancer patients and 4 human bladder cancer cell lines, compared with the healthy volunteers and SU-HUC-1 human normal bladder epithelial cells.
Treatment with dioscin decreased viability of BC 5637 and T24 cells, but not non-cancer bladder epithelial cell, SV-HUC-1.
A primary deficiency of protein C or S is proposed which would produce cerebral thrombosis with exposure of phospholipids; this thrombosis then, like antigens, would generate antibodies acting on the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, exacerbating the thrombotic process.
To investigate whether defects in the SPATA17 gene are associated with azoospermia due to meiotic arrest, a mutational analysis was conducted, in which the SPATA17 coding regions of 18 Japanese patients with this condition were sequenced.
The frequencies of erythrocyte MNSs antigens and certain histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) specificities (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR) were determined in white patients with meningitis or epiglottitis due to Haemophilus influenzae type b and in controls.
Analysis of antigen expression pattern, the presence or absence of T cell-associated antigen deletion, and the expression of CD10 and CD34 by 4-color flow cytometry can help differentiate thymoma from T-cell ALL/LBL.
We found that CYC1 was upregulated in breast tumor tissues, especially in tissues with lymph node metastasis.
And higher expression of CYC1 correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients using online databases and tools.
Then we confirmed that CYC1 contributed to metastasis and proliferation in two highly metastatic human breast cancer cell lines.
Our results indicated that CYC1 plays crucial roles in breast cancer progression and might be a predictive factor assisting future patient diagnosis.
Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase hinge protein (UQCRH), as a connecter between cytochrome c1 with cytochrome c in complex III of respiratory chain, is top-ranked hypermethylated gene in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).
This study aimed at testing a panel of nine reference genes [beta-2-microglobulin, cytochrome c-1 (CYC1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hydroxymethylbilane synthase, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase 1, ribosomal protein L13a (RPL13A), succinate dehydrogenase, TATA-box binding protein and 14-3-3 protein zeta] to identify and validate the most suitable reference genes for expression studies in human glioma of different grades (World Health Organization grades II-IV).
After analysis of the stability values calculated using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms, GAPDH, RPL13A, and CYC1 can be indicated as reference genes applicable for accurate normalization of gene expression in glioma compared with normal brain and anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma alone within this experimental setting.
Kaplan-Meier plots identified correlations between individual or combined overexpression of E2F1, E2F3a, Mps1/TTK, Nek2, BubR1, or Hec1 and poor overall and relapse-free survival of breast cancer patients.
By interrogating the METABRIC database, we observed a significant correlation between p53 expression and that of c-Abl and TTK in basal-like breast cancers.
The protein kinase threonine tyrosine kinase (TTK; also known as Mps1) is a critical component of the spindle assembly checkpoint and a promising drug target for the treatment of aggressive cancers, such as triple negative breast cancer.
High levels of the mitotic checkpoint kinase Mps1/TTK have correlated with high histologic grade in breast cancer, suggesting a potential new therapeutic target for aggressive breast cancers (BC).
These compounds were evaluated in anti-proliferative assays of a panel of 15 breast cancer cell lines and further examined for their ability to inhibit a variety of Mps1-dependent biological functions.
In addition, the lead compounds 1 and 13 inhibit Mps1 kinase enzymatic activity with IC50 values from 0.356myM to 0.809myM, and inhibited Mps1-associated cellular functions such as centrosome duplication and the spindle checkpoint in triple negative breast cancer cells.
Using drug discovery technologies, computational modeling, medicinal chemistry, cell culture and in vivo assays, novel small molecule Mps1/TTK inhibitors have been identified as potential targeted therapies for breast cancers.
However, high levels of Mps1 are found in many types of human malignancies, including glioblastoma, thyroid carcinoma, breast cancer, and other cancers.
Here, we employed amphiphilic polymers and silenced the expression of two cell cycle proteins, TTK and CDC20, and the anti-apoptosis protein survivin to determine the efficacy of polymer-mediated siRNA treatment in breast cancer cells as well as side effects in nonmalignant cells in vitro.
To explore expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor-Beta1 (TGF-Beta1) in valve tissue of rheumatic heart disease (RHD), and to analyzed their roles in RHD.
Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate plasma ADAMTS-13 activity in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis and to evaluate the role of clinical, laboratory and pathological features, especially the vascular lesions in lupus nephritis.
Results Plasma ADAMTS-13 activity in lupus nephritis patients was significantly lower than that in normal controls (84 +/- 21% vs. 90 +/- 13%, p = 0.005).
Conclusions Decreased ADAMTS-13 activity was found in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis, and plasma ADAMTS-13 activity was closely associated with renal injury indices, especially pathological vascular scores.
The serum ADAMTS-13 activity was significantly lower in patients with both lupus nephritis and TTP-HUS than in patients with lupus nephritis only and in normal control (40% versus 69%, P = 0.012; 40% versus 81%, P &lt; 0.001, respectively).
The prevalence of ADAMTS-13 autoantibodies was significantly higher in patients with both lupus nephritis and TTP-HUS than in patients with lupus nephritis only and in normal control (6/7, 86% versus 10/55, 18%, P &lt; 0.001; 6/7, 86% versus 0, P &lt; 0.001, respectively).
ADAMTS-13 autoantibodies might play an important role in the pathogenesis of TTP-HUS associated with lupus nephritis.
Plasma vWF and vWF-CP activities were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and residual collagen binding assay respectively in patients with lupus nephritis (n = 31), primary nephritic syndrome (n = 25), diabetic nephropathy (n = 45), chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 38) and 40 normal controls.
Renal biopsy demonstrated that the vWF level in stage IV was higher than in stages II and III while vWF-CP activity was lower in patients with lupus nephritis.
Furthermore the demonstration of a normal vWF-CP assay aided in the distinction between TTP and MAHA due to lupus nephritis.
In this study we have investigated the distribution and the level of expression of kinesin light chains (KLCs) (responsible for binding of cargos during anterograde transport) and of dynein intermediate chain (DIC) (a component of the dynein complex during retrograde transport) in frontal cortex and cerebellar cortex of control subjects and Alzheimer's disease patients.
By immunoblotting, we found a significant decrease in the levels of expression of KLC1 and 2 and DIC in the frontal cortex, but not in the cerebellar cortex, of Alzheimer's disease patients.
We suggest that reduction of KLCs and DIC proteins in AD cortex results from both reduced expression and neuronal loss, and that these reductions and GSK-3Beta-mediated phosphorylation of KLC1 contribute to disturbances of axoplasmic flows and synaptic integrity in Alzheimer's disease.
Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) often have suboptimal adherence rates to nebulized medication.
A cocktail of three phages active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients was developed for a potential nebulized formulation.
Treatment regimen for families of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is considerable, particularly when nebulised therapies for chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection are prescribed.
The time requirements for multiple daily nebulizer treatments are important impediments to the quality of life for most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
Therefore, in this study, the author describes for the first time the common feature of oral clefts in patients carrying a microduplication of 15q13.3 encompassing the CHRNA7 gene, which sheds light on the correlation between CHRNA7 and cleft palate.
In contrast to GTG banding, array CGH determined the exact number of deleted genes and thus allowed the identification of candidate genes for cleft palate (GREM1, CX36, MEIS2), congenital heart defect (ACTC, GREM1, CX36, MEIS2), and mental retardation (ARHGAP11A, CHRNA7, CHRM5).
Comparative deletion mapping shows that this region can be dissected into five chromosomal segments containing at least six candidate genes (DAB1, HOOK1, NFIA, DOCK7, DNAJC6, and PDE4B) most likely responsible for syndromic intellectual disability, which was corroborated by their reduced transcript levels in RT-qPCR.
Importantly, one patient with an intragenic microdeletion within NFIA and an additional patient with a balanced translocation disrupting NFIA display intellectual disability coupled with macrocephaly.
We propose NFIA is responsible for intellectual disability coupled with macrocephaly, and microdeletions at 1p31.3p32.2 constitute a contiguous gene syndrome with several genes contributing to syndromic intellectual disability.
Non-progressive cerebellar ataxia with mental retardation (CANPMR, OMIM 614756) and chromosome 1p32-p31 deletion syndrome (OMIM 613735) are two very rare inherited disorders, which are caused by mono-allelic deficiency (haplo-insufficiency) of calmodulin-binding transcription activator 1 (CAMTA1) and, respectively, nuclear factor 1 A (NFIA) genes.
Among these 24 genes, four transcription factors Auts2, Nfia, Nr4a2, and Sox5 were found, suggesting that TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis.
Some of these maternal and maternal-child associations were in or adjacent to autism candidate genes including: PCDH9, FOXP1, GABRB3, NRXN1, RELN, MACROD2, FHIT, RORA, CNTN4, CNTNAP2, FAM135B, LAMA1, NFIA, NLGN4X, RAPGEF4, and SDK1.
These results provided a mechanistic linking between TRPM2-mediated Ca2+ influx and p47 phox signaling to induce excess ROS production and TXNIP-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation under HG, and suggested that TRPM2 represented a potential target for alleviating NLRP3 inflammasome activation related to hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress in Type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).
SOX3 mutations have been associated with growth hormone deficiency, variable degrees of additional pituitary hormone deficiencies, and mental retardation.
SOX3 involvement should be considered in a male with short stature due to GH deficiency associated with intellectual disability.
A further XX male, ascertained because of intellectual disability, carried a de novo cryptic duplication at Xq27.1, involving SOX3.
In humans, over- and underdosage of SOX3 is associated with X-linked hypopituitarism with variable phenotypes ranging from isolated GH deficiency (GHD) to panhypopituitarism, with or without mental retardation and, in most cases, with reported pituitary imaging, an ectopic/undescended posterior pituitary.
Screening for SOX3 should be advised not only for hypopituitary patients with an ectopic posterior pituitary, but also for those with a structurally normal pituitary and additional findings, including clefts and a persistent craniopharyngeal canal, with or without mental retardation.
Both duplications encompassing SOX3 and loss-of function mutations in SOX3 have been reported in a minor portion of X-linked isolated growth hormone deficiency (GHD) or combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) patients with or without mental retardation.
In humans, duplication of SOX3 and polyalanine expansions at its C-terminus may cause intellectual disability and hypopituitarism.
The UNH159 marker as well as RNA-binding motif protein, X-linked (rbmx), SRY-box containing gene 3 (sox3) and alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (atrx) genes were mapped to linkage group 2.
Both overdosage of SOX3, as a result of gene duplication, and loss of function resulting from expansion of the first polyalanine (PA) tract are associated with variable degrees of hypopituitarism, with or without mental retardation.
Duplications and polyalanine expansions within the transcription factor SOX3 have recently been described in association with infundibular hypoplasia, hypopituitarism and variable mental retardation, whilst mutations in SOX2 are associated with variable hypopituitarism in association with learning difficulties, oesophageal atresia and anophthalmia.
Using mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, which divide rapidly, yet in retinoic acid adopt a neuronal phenotype, admixed with occasional (approximately 10%) fibroblast-like cells, together with a panel of peptide-specific antibodies raised to 7 of the 8 CCT subunits we show that; (1) adoption of a post mitotic phenotype is accompanied by reduced CCT protein expression, significantly more so for CCTbeta, CCTdelta, CCTepsilon, and CCTtheta than for CCTalpha (TCP-1), CCTgamma and CCTzeta; (2) CCTalpha is detected preferentially over other subunits in neurites of P19 neurons; (3) small amounts of CCTalpha and gamma are localised in nuclei (i.e.
In line with these observations, in preclinical models, SIRT2 deficiency increases survival of mice with chronic staphylococcal infection, while having no effect on the course of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, LPS or TNF-induced shock, fulminant Escherichia coli peritonitis, sub-lethal Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia, and chronic candidiasis.
Lung injury was studied by measuring: vascular permeability-related pulmonary edema; histopathologic scores, neutrophil infiltration and concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar fluid; expression of inflammatory enzymes and sirtuin (SIRT) 1 as well as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-KB) activity in pulmonary tissues.
The aim of our study was to compare the expression of sirtuin in large and small airways in nonsmokers, asymptomatic smokers, and smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Smokers both with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had decreased sirtuin expression in large airways.
However, in small airways, sirtuin expression was decreased only in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Smoking is characterized by suppressed sirtuin expression in large airways, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by more severe suppression of sirtuin expression both in large and small airways.
Human equilibrative nucleoside transporters (hENT) 1 and 2, encoded by SLC29A1 and SLC29A2, permit the bidirectional passage of nucleoside analogues into cells and may correlate with clinical responses to chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression profiles of SLC29A1 and SLC29A2 in human cancer cell lines.
Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we comprehensively profiled the transcription levels of SLC29A1 and SLC29A2 in 16 colon cancer cell lines.
We validated the ubiquitous and heterogeneous distribution of SLC29A1 and SLC29A2 in human colon cancer cell lines and demonstrated that SLC29A1 was highly expressed in 25% of metastatic cell lines (Colo201 and Colo205) and 62.5% of primary cell lines (Caco2, Colo320, HCT116, RKO, and SW48).
For the first time, we showed that both SLC29A1 and SLC29A2 were expressed at lower levels in colon cancer cell lines originating from metastatic sites than from primary sites.
As ENT inhibitors including dilazep have shown efficacy improving oHSV1 targeted oncolytic cancer therapy, a series of dilazep analogues was synthesized and biologically evaluated to examine both ENT1 and ENT2 inhibition.
The most significant changes common to HLHS-RV versus control-RV and control-LV sample groups is observed for Anti mullerian hormone receptor 2 (AMHR2) (+18.79 control-RV, +3.38 control-LV), and the BMP antagonist Inhibin alpha (INHA) (+11.47 control-RV, +5.73 control-LV).
We have described previously the Ets family member ERM/ETV5 specifically upregulated in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma (EEC) associated with myometrial infiltration.
We have described recently the Ets family transcription factor, ERM/ETV5, specifically up-regulated in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC) and associated with myometrial infiltration.
Finally, the specific localization of ERM/ETV5 and MMP-2 at the invasive front of myometrial infiltrating human endometrial carcinomas further reinforced the hypothesis of a role for ERM/ETV5 in the early steps of endometrial dissemination.
Most importantly, the defects seen in Gfi1 deficient mice also point to roles of Gfi1 in diseases of the immune system that involve auto-immune responses and acute lymphoid leukemia and lymphoma.
The results showed that the gfi-1 expression level in all leukemia patients was significantly higher than that in normal group (p &lt; 0.05); the gfi-1 mRNA expression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) patients was significantly higher than that in normal group (p &lt; 0.05); but the difference of gfi-1 mRNA expression between AL and CML or ALL and AML was not significant.
The MDM2 309GG genotype was linked to a higher risk of acute G3-4 dermatitis.
In an antibody microarray chip analysis, MDM2 expression was increased in atopic dermatitis patients.
All doxorubicin (Dox)-resistant tumors expressed higher levels of cancer stem-like cell biomarkers, including CD44, Wnt and its receptor LRP5/6, relative to Dox-sensitive tumors.
Our results showed that simultaneous binding to LRP5/6 and uPAR by the dual receptor targeted IONPs was required to inhibit breast cancer cell invasion.
STAT5 LKO caused hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia and elevated free fatty acid and cholesterol concentrations under HFD feeding but induced only hyperglycemia on normal diet.
Prx2 is a key cytoprotector against IO that is induced either by iron supplementation or due to chronic hemolysis as in Beta-thalassemia.
Peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2), a typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin, is upregulated during Beta-thalassemic erythropoiesis, but its contribution to stress erythropoiesis, a common feature of thalassemia, is yet to be fully defined.
In the present study, we aimed to investigate plasma levels of peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) and thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), and the activity of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), in thalassemia major (TM) patients living in the Antalya region, Turkey.
Proteomic analysis of microparticles released from thalassemia intermedia erythrocytes indicated that, besides hemichromes and clustered band 3, the microparticles contain a characteristic set of proteins that includes catalase, heat shock protein 70, peroxiredoxin 2 and carbonic anhydrase.
Interestingly, Prx II interacted with Hb in mouse RBCs, and their interaction, in particular, was severely impaired in RBCs of patients with thalassemia (THAL) and sickle cell anemia (SCA).
The cover image, by Lihadh Al Gazali et al., is based on the Original Article A recessive syndrome of intellectual disability, moderate overgrowth, and renal dysplasia predisposing to Wilms tumor is caused by a mutation in FIBP gene, DOI:10.1002/ajmg.a.37741.
Different observational clinical studies reported that circulating levels of ANGPTL2 increase significantly in various chronic inflammatory diseases and showed associations between ANGPTL2 levels and diagnosis and/or prognosis of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and various types of cancers.
Circulating ANGPTL2 is increased in chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the risk of CVD is amplified.
The positive association between post-KTx ANGPTL2, aortic stiffness and mortality, suggests that ANGPTL2 may play a biological role in CKD-related CVD.
Histological analysis of human kidneys indicated abundant expression of angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2) in renal tubule epithelial cells during progression of renal fibrosis.
Furthermore, ANGPTL2 deficiency in a mouse unilateral ureteral obstruction model significantly reduced renal fibrosis by decreasing TGF-Beta1 signal amplification in kidney.
Thus, ANGPTL2 and TGF-Beta1 positively regulate each other as renal fibrosis progresses.
demonstrated that genetic depletion of Angptl2 confers amelioration of the mouse kidney fibrosis induced by a unilateral ureteral obstruction, implicating that ANGPTL2, predominantly in the renal tubular compartments, activates the transforming growth factor-Beta signaling and vice versa through miR-221.
In the present study, we tested whether there is a correlation between increased ANGPTL2 expression and inflammation in response to Staphylococcus aureus in murine mastitis and the mechanisms involved.
The present findings indicate ANGPTL2 may mediate the inflammation in murine mastitis through the activation of IL-6 and TNF-Alfa.
The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum Angptl2 level and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
The age- and sex-adjusted ORs for the presence of CKD increased with higher serum Angptl2 level.
Elevated serum Angptl2 is associated with the likelihood of CKD in the general population.
We investigated whether serum Angptl2 levels are associated with diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.
This suggests a possible role of Angptl2 in progressive nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Improvements to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based genotyping assays currently used for detection of mutations responsible for bovine ferrochelatase and myophosphorylase deficiencies, and equine hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) are described.
Thus, peripheral changes of TOAG-1 and RHAMM expression can be used to predict clinical response to Alefacept treatment in psoriasis patients.
In this study, we examined the pharmacological profile of KCL-440, a new PARP inhibitor, and its neuroprotective effects in the rat acute cerebral infarction model induced by photothrombotic middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion.
Our data thus suggest that the tested PARP polymorphisms do not principally contribute to cerebral infarction, although extensive searches would be required to clarify whether the PARP gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of human stroke.
The OR of breast cancer for the percentage BPE measure (BPE%) quantified from SUB1 was 3.5 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.3, 9.8; p = 0.015) for 20% increments.
In this study, we show elevated expression of SUB1 in aggressive prostate cancer.
Knockdown of SUB1 in prostate cancer cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro, and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.
PLK1 knockdown or use of PLK1 inhibitor can mitigate oncogenic function of SUB1 in benign prostate cancer cells.
Thus, our study suggests that miR-101 loss results in increased SUB1 expression and subsequent activation of known oncogenes driving prostate cancer progression and metastasis.
This study therefore demonstrates functional role of SUB1 in prostate cancer, and identifies its regulation and potential downstream therapeutic targets of SUB1 in prostate cancer.
The proposed study aims to explore whether PC4 correlates with VEGF-C/VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 axis of lymphangiogenesis in the lymph node metastasis during lung adenocarcinoma.
Here, small interfering RNA technique was employed to investigate the relationship of PC4 and the VEGF-C/VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 axis in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines as well as tumor xenografts of mice model.
PC4 expression correlated with the levels of VEGF-C, VEGF-D and VEGFR-3 during the development of lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma in vitro and in vivo, which may be a novel marker in the development of lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis of tumors.
To test the hypothesis that elevated urinary levels of soluble E-cadherin (sE-cadherin) would aid in the detection of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder.
We propose potential pathogenic pathways for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in diabetic patients based on altered integrin and cadherin distribution in urothelial cells in diabetic patients.
To evaluate soluble E-cadherin (sE-cadherin) as a potential tumour marker in patients with transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder (previously shown to correlate with tumour grade, number of Ta/T1 tumours at presentation and a positive 3-month check cystoscopy) by assessing its serum concentration in relation to transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT).
Elevated mRNA expression of liver IL-6, IL-17A, IL-17F, TGF-Beta1, Alfa-SMA, TGR5, NTCP, OATP1a1, and ileum ASBT and decreased liver IL-10, FXR, CAR, VDR, BSEP, MRP2, MRP3, MRP4 was also observed in ANIT-induced cholestasis but were attenuated or normalized by YCHT.
The objective of the present study is to evaluate whether IL-6, TNF-Alfa, IL-10 are associated with nutritional status in patients with cirrhosis secondary to biliary atresia and compare to healthy controls.
The authors suggest that, in patients with cirrhosis secondary to biliary atresia, IL-6 could be used as a possible supporting biomarker of deficient nutritional status and elevated IL-10 levels could be used as a possible early-stage supporting biomarker of deteriorating nutritional status.
In a prospective study, 47 patients with obstructive jaundice secondary to malignant lesions were evaluated before, at the fifth hour after, and on the fifth day after PTBD for neopterin, nitrate, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Alfa, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, CRP levels, and liver function.
It has been reported that the hypermethylation of APAF-1, DAPK-1 and other tumor suppressive genes (TSGs) correlates with progression of renal cell carcinoma and exerts prognostic and diagnostic relevance in renal cell carcinoma.
The present study confirmed that DAC demethylated the CpGs, particularly APAF-1 in renal carcinoma cells, and that the demethylation synergized the cytotoxity of CDDP in renal carcinoma cells via enhancing the CDDP-induced apoptosis.
The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and relevance of promoter methylation of the tumor suppressor DAPK-1, APAF-1 () and SPARC in relation to different pathological stages and histological grades of tumor progression that might act as possible independent prognostic factor in the susceptibility towards renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in North Indian population.
To examine the significance of the methylation level of the p53 target and tumour suppressor genes apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (APAF-1) and death-associated protein kinase-1 (DAPK-1) in 80 microdissected tumour samples from transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder and 80 tumour samples from clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) as well as from non-tumourous bladder and kidney tissue.
Quantification of mRNA expression of HNF1B, six of its potential target genes (PKHD1, PKD1, PKD2, IFT88, TMEM27 and UMOD) and three genes involved in the Mg(2+) renal homeostasis (ATP1A1, FXYD2 and CLDN16) in the urinary sediment of 11 individuals with mutation of HNF1B and in 9 controls (non-invasive assessment of the renal transcriptome).
Collectrin is a downstream target of the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor-1alpha (HNF-1alpha), which is mutated in maturity-onset diabetes of the young subtype 3 (MODY3).
Several forms of ichthyosis are associated with neurologic manifestations, including Sjoegren-Larsson syndrome, Refsum disease, and mental retardation-enteropathy-deafness-neuropathy-ichthyosis-keratoderma (MEDNIK) syndrome.
To determine the difference in thrombomodulin expression in the myometrium and in myoma; and to understand the correlation of anticoagulation/fibrinolytic function and the mechanism of uterine artery occlusion in the treatment of leiomyoma.
The relative transcription of thrombomodulin mRNA was 1.28 times higher in myometrial tissue than in myomal tissue (P &lt; 0.05).
Similarly, leiomyoma-associated endometrium expressed less PAI-1 and thrombomodulin in vivo.
Alfa-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase (AMACR) and insulin-like growth factor-II mRNA-binding protein 3 (IMP3) are 2 markers helpful in detecting difficult cases of dysplasia in Barrett esophagus (BE).
To investigate the value of Alfa-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) immunohistochemistry for predicting neoplastic progression in Barrett's oesophagus (BO).
The aim of this study was to evaluate AMACR expression in the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence in Barrett's esophagus (BE), ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohn's disease (CD) and to determine whether its expression can be used to detect dysplastic epithelium in these conditions.
These associations implicate genes related to apoptosis (HRK), development (WIF1), oxidative stress (MSR3B), ubiquitination (FBXW8) and neuronal migration (ASTN2), as well as enzymes targeted by new diabetes medications (DPP4), indicating new genetic influences on hippocampal size and possibly the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.
Histomorphometrical analysis of experimental implants inserted in the femurs of CKD mice revealed a trend of decreased BIC ratio at 2-week healing.
A Cochrane Collaboration review (Roderick, Cochrane Data base of systemic reviews 2007, DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD0018.90.pub3) reported that there was no evidence for correction of acidosis by sodium bicarbonate in pre-end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, and concluded that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are necessary to evaluate the benefits and harms of correcting metabolic acidosis in pre-ESRD patients.
We will randomize 600 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3b and 4; 300 of these patients will be included in the bicarbonate study group (Bic), in which levels of bicarbonate should be kept &gt;24 mEq/L; the other 300 patients will be included in the usual-treatment group (no-Bic).
Acid-Base Disorders in CKD: Moderate metabolic acidosis (Bic 16-20) mEq/L is common with glomerular filtration rates below 20 ml/min, and favors bone demineralization due to the release of calcium and phosphate from the bone, chronic hyperventilation, and muscular weakness and atrophy.
In a prospective randomized crossover trial, patients with acute renal failure received CRRT with either sodium bicarbonate (Bic) or sodium lactate (Lac) as a buffering agent over 2 consecutive 24-h periods.
The combination of bicarbonate and mannitol (BIC/MAN) is commonly used to prevent renal failure (RF) in patients with rhabdomyolysis despite the absence of sufficient evidence validating its use.
To unmask weak inputs from outside the conventional RF (CRF), cell excitability was raised by iontophoretic application of glutamate (GLU) and/or bicuculline methiodide (BIC) or by light stimulation of the CRF.
Bicarbonate-buffered replacement fluid (RF-bic) in continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) may be superior to lactate-buffered replacement fluid (RF-lac) in acute renal failure.
In an open, randomized, multicenter study, we investigated the effects of RF-bic and RF-lac on cardiovascular outcome in patients requiring CVVH following acute renal failure.
The data also suggest that the use of RF-bic during CVVH reduces cardiovascular events in critically ill patients with acute renal failure, particularly those with previous cardiovascular disease or heart failure.
The effect of BIC on whisker-evoked responses was a preferential enhancement in the responses elicited by the whisker giving rise to the highest probability response (center receptive field whisker or CRF).
The primary influence of BIC and, to a lesser degree, 2-OH-S was to prolong the response duration of VPM neurons to CRF whisker stimulation.
Selective PDE5 inhibitors have shown potential in treating kidney fibrosis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), via their downstream signaling, and these inhibitors also have known activity as antithrombotic and anticancer agents.
The FGF9 subfamily, including FGF9, FGF16, and FGF20, in addition to rhFGF16, rhFGF9, and rhFGF20, were shown to stimulate the proliferation and migration of HuH7 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.
Furthermore, the results indicate that exogenous rhFGF9- and rhFGF20-activated ERK/NF-KB signal transduction pathways play important roles in the regulation of HCC cell proliferation and migration, and this discovery helps to find the potential for new solutions of the treatment of liver cancer.
These include FGF3 in Michel aplasia; FGF8 in cleft lip/palate and in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism; FGF9 in carcinoma; FGF10 in the lacrimal/salivary glands aplasia, and lacrimo-auriculo-dento-digital syndrome; FGF14 in spinocerebellar ataxia; FGF20 in Parkinson disease; and FGF23 in tumoral calcinosis and hypophosphatemic rickets.
Molecular genetics and developmental studies have identified 21 genes in this region (ADRA1A, ARHGEF10, CHRNA2, CHRNA6, CHRNB3, DKK4, DPYSL2, EGR3, FGF17, FGF20, FGFR1, FZD3, LDL, NAT2, NEF3, NRG1, PCM1, PLAT, PPP3CC, SFRP1 and VMAT1/SLC18A1) that are most likely to contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder and depression), neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease) and cancer.
EphrinB2 (erythropoietin-producing hepatoma interactor B2), a pivotal bidirectional signaling molecule ubiquitously expressed in mammals, is crucial in angiogenesis during development and disease progression.
The aim of the present study was to detect the correlation between the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin 2 (Ang2), ephrinB2 and endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF) and carcinogenesis or portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) formation in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
We investigated whether the human MBX gene was associated with susceptibility to microphthalmia by analyzing four Korean families demonstrating microphthalmia with congenital cataract.
Therefore, no indications were found for an association between the MBX gene and microphthalmia with congenital cataract in humans.
Sequence changes have been observed for both NCKX1 and NCKX2 in patients with retinal diseases, but a definitive association with retinal disease has not been shown.
To study the possible involvement of the rod (SLC24A1) and cone (SLC24A2) Na-Ca+K exchanger (NCKX) genes in retinal diseases.
Approximately 23% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer exhibit somatic or germline aberrations in genes implicated in DNA repair, such as BRCA2, BRCA1, ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2, as well as mismatch repair genes.
Men who inherit pathogenic germline mutations in BRCA2 and BRCA1 are at increased risk of developing aggressive prostate cancer, and those with germline mutations in other DNA repair genes such as ATM, CHEK2, and MSH2/MSH6 may also have increased risks.
The CHEK2 gene del5395 is a founder mutation in the Latvian population, which, however, does not have a direct impact on genetic predisposition toward colorectal, breast, ovarian and prostate cancer.
Human limbal neurospheres expressed the neural lineage markers, Nestin, sex determining region box-2 and N-cadherin, and the retinal transcription factors microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, sex determining region box-2 and orthodentical homeobox-2.
Mutations of orthodentricle homeobox 2 (OTX2) in human and mice often cause retinal dystrophy and nyctalopia, suggesting a role of OTX2 in mature retina, in addition to its functions in the development of the eye and retina.
THE ROLE OF ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) affect the different mechanisms that lead to glomerulosclerosis: antihypertensive effect, with the normalisation of blood pressure having demonstrated its determining role in the production of nephrosis in various epidemiological studies; hemodynamic effect with a decrease in glomerular capillary pressure, in the filtration fraction, and inhibition of the bradykinin deterioration; antiproteinuric effect superior to that of other anti-hypertensive drugs (excepting angiotensin II-receptor antagonists).
To investigate whether the reduction in proteinuria is due to decreased generation of angiotensin II (AngII) or to decreased degradation of bradykinin, four series of experiments in established adriamycin nephrosis were performed.
There were few reports demonstrating behavior of kinin and kininogen in the nephrotic syndrome.
In this paper, coagulation factors related to contact activation, such as factor XII (FXII), factor XI (FXI), prekallikrein (PK), high molecular weight kininogen (HMWKG), and kinins were measured in 15 cases of nephrotic syndrome, and clinical significance of these results were discussed.
It was concluded that kinin formation in the nephrotic syndrome was not due to the activation of intrinsic coagulation system but due to release of kinin from low molecular weight kininogen.
To investigate the role of anti-inflammatory TSG-6 in controlling MMP-1 and MMP-3, which have been shown to be upregulated in conjunctivochalasis (CCh).
Direct sequencing analyses were performed in 19 genes, including ALS/frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)-related genes (SOD2, SOD3, ALS2/alsin, SMN1, PGRN, ANG, VEGF, VCP, VAPB, DCTN1, CHMP2B, and TARDBP or TDP-43), tauopathy-related gene (GSK3beta), and parkinsonism-related genes (alpha-synuclein, LRRK2, parkin, DJ-1, PINK1, and ATP13A2).
This patient broadens the phenotypic spectrum of the 22q11.2 microduplication syndrome and raises the possibility that TUBA8 and USP18 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of amyoplasia.
Despite the support for including patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and health-related quality of life in clinical trials, there have been deficiencies in how these have been assessed and reported in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) clinical trials.
To redress this, the 5th Ovarian Cancer Consensus Conference, included a plenary session entitled 'How to include PROs in clinical trials'.
To test the hypothesis that ovarian cancer patients with worse PROs would drop out earlier, we examined how patients differed by time of dropout on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), anxiety, depression, optimism and insomnia.
Progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were significantly improved by adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) in the phase III AURELIA trial.
Despite increased recognition of the value of including patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as important end points in phase III clinical trials, there has been a lack of pre-specified PRO hypotheses and shortcomings with the analyses and interpretation of PROs in many ovarian cancer trials.
Promoting the importance of hypothesis-driven PROs in ovarian cancer clinical trials will lead to improvements in the design of these trials and the interpretation of their results.
We conducted the Surgery in Ovarian Cancer Quality of life Evaluation Research study (SOCQER 1), a prospective study investigating the feasibility of collection of serial PROs in patients who had extensive surgery and standard surgery for ovarian cancer.
There is no consensus as to what symptoms or quality-of-life (QOL) domains should be measured as patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in ovarian cancer clinical trials.
The results were included in and combined with an expert consensus-building process to identify the most salient PROs for ovarian cancer clinical trials.
We identified a set of PROs specific to ovarian cancer: abdominal pain, bloating, cramping, fear of recurrence/disease progression, indigestion, sexual dysfunction, vomiting, weight gain, and weight loss.
Findings of the review and consensus process provide good support for use of these ovarian cancer-specific PROs in ovarian cancer clinical trials.
Mutations within this gene are responsible for kinesigenic paroxysmal dyskinesias (PKD) as well as for benign familial infantile epilepsy (BFIE), a disease associating infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA), a form of familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM type 4), paroxysmal benign torticollis of childhood, and episodic ataxia.
FHM type 4 is attributed to mutations in the PRRT2 gene, which encodes a proline-rich transmembrane protein of as yet unknown function.
Two PRRT2 mutations were in familial hemiplegic migraine or episodic ataxia, one SLC2A1 family had episodic ataxia and one PNKD family had familial hemiplegic migraine alone.
SLC2A1 mutations were associated with variable phenotypes including paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia, episodic ataxia and myotonia and we identified a novel PNKD gene deletion in familial hemiplegic migraine.
We assessed the clinical features of both FHM families and performed direct sequencing of all coding exons (and adjacent sequences) of the CACNA1A, ATP1A2, PRRT2 and SCN1A genes.
In 2012, PRRT2 has been identified as the fourth FHM gene, and encodes an axonal protein associated to the exocytosis complex.
To characterise the phenotype of a family with paroxysmal exercise induced dystonia (PED) and migraine and establish whether it is linked to the paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) locus on chromosome 2q33-35, the familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) locus on chromosome 19p, or the familial infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis (ICCA syndrome) locus on chromosome 16.
Haplotypes were reconstructed for all the available family members by typing several microsatellite markers spanning the PNKD, FHM, and ICCA loci.
Linkage of the disease to the PNKD, FHM, or ICCA loci was excluded as no common haplotype was shared by all the affected members for each locus.
This family presented with the classic phenotype of PED and is not linked to the PNKD, FHM, or ICCA loci.
The (FZr-EUl/FZl-EUr) and (FZr-EUr)/(FZl-EUl) were used for the patients with unicoronal craniosynostosis.
Our findings indicated that all evaluated parameters (epididymal sperm profile, Johnsen score, Plzf, GfrAlfa-1, Scp-1, Tekt-1 expressions, and histopathological profile) were significantly decreased following testicular torsion (group 3) when compared to the control group (p &lt;= 0.05).
Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) is a rare type of pigmentary genodermatosis, which is autosomal dominantly inherited with high penetrance.
The onset of DSH is typically during infancy or childhood.
Additionally, there have been few significant non-cutaneous complications reported with DSH.
The present study reported two sporadic cases of patients born with DSH, confirmed by the identification of ADAR1 mutations.
Additionally, comorbidity of DSH, congenital heart disease (CHD) and hemangioma disease were first reported.
In the patient with isolated DSH from birth, a nonsense mutation (p.Y1192X) was identified, whereas in the second patient with DSH, CHD and hemangioma from birth, a frameshift mutation (p.Glu673ValfsX652) in ADAR1 was identified.
To the best of the authors' knowledge, &gt;120 mutations in ADAR1 have been reported to cause DSH; however, no previous studies have reported mutations in ADAR1 in DSH at birth, with CHD and hemangioma.
The novel variants described in the current study add to the current knowledge of ADAR1 mutations in DSH.
Pathogenic molecular variants in the ADAR gene are a known cause of rare diseases, autosomal recessive Aicardi- Goutieres syndrome type 6, severe infantile encephalopathy with intracranial calcifications and dominant dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria, demonstrated mainly in Asian adults.
To identify potential mutation of the ADAR1 gene in a Chinese family and a sporadic case affected with dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria(DSH).
The frame-shift mutation c.2638delG (p.Asp880ThrfsX15) and the nonsense mutation c.2867C&gt;A (p.Ser956X) in the ADAR1 gene probably underlie the DSH in our patients.
Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) is a rare autosomal dominant cutaneous disorder caused by the mutations of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA1 (ADAR1) gene.
We present a clinical and genetic study of seven unrelated families and two sporadic cases with DSH for mutations in the full coding sequence of ADAR1 gene.
ADAR1 gene was sequenced in seven unrelated families and two sporadic cases with DSH and 120 controls.
We describe six novel mutations of the ADAR1 gene in Chinese patients with DSH including a nonstop mutation p.Stop1227R, which was firstly reported in ADAR1 gene.
A three-generation family exhibiting phenotypic variability with a single germline ADAR1 mutation suggests that chilblain might aggravate the clinical phenotypes of DSH.
All patients underwent upper endoscopy and subsequently liver CT. Three radiologists independently evaluated the presence of high-risk esophageal varices with transverse images alone and with three orthogonal multiplanar reformation (MPR) images, respectively.
To study the correlation between changes in portosystemic collaterals, evaluated by multidetector-row computed tomography imaging using multiplanar reconstruction (MDCT-MPR), and prognosis in patients with hemorrhagic esophageal varices (EV) after endoscopic treatment.
The purpose of our study was to assess the relationship between hemodynamic changes in portosystemic collaterals and the prognosis of patients with esophageal varices after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy using multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) MDCT images.
MPR MDCT images on portosystemic collaterals can accurately predict relapse of esophageal varices after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy.
TTD is caused by mutations in DNA repair/transcription genes XPD, XPB or TTDA, and in TTDN1, a gene of unknown function.
To date, four genes have been identified as responsible for TTD: XPD, XPB, p8/TTDA, and TTDN1.
We analysed the gene expression and protein distribution of different members of the Hsp27, Hsp70, and Hsp90 families in the central nervous system of sheep naturally infected with scrapie.
We have previously shown that scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma (ScN2a) cells fail to induce the expression of Hsp72 and Hsp28 after various stress conditions.
In scrapie-infected N2a (ScN2a) cells, Hsp72 and Hsp28 were not induced by heat shock, sodium arsenite, or an amino acid analog, in contrast to uninfected control N2a cells, while other inducible Hsps were increased by these treatments.
We have identified Receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 4 (RIP4) as a regulator of tumor differentiation in lung adenocarcinoma (AC).
Altogether, our work has identified that loss of RIP4 enhances STAT3 signaling in lung cancer cells, promoting the expression of ECM remodeling genes and cancer dedifferentiation.
In conclusion, our data suggest that RIPK4/EZH2 markers might be used as potential predictors of prognosis in cervical cancer.
To investigate the association between receptor-interacting kinase protein 4 (RIPK4) relative copy number (RCN) and prognosis of stage III( colorectal cancer (CRC) patients treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.
In colon cancer subgroup, high RIPK4 RCN was significantly associated with poor OS (median OS, 31.5 months vs. 56.6 months, P=0.015) but not with RFS (P=0.135).
In rectal cancer subgroup, RIPK4 RCN was not associated with both OS and RFS (P=0.981, P=0.738).
RIPK4 RCN is significantly associated with OS in stage III( colon cancer patients receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and may be a novel biomarker that can predict the efficacy of oxaliplatin in colon cancer patients.
Aberrant expression of receptor interacting protein kinase 4 (RIPK4), a crucial regulatory protein of Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling, has recently been reported to be involved in several cancers.
Here, we report the potential clinical implication and biological functions of RIPK4 in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC).
RIPK4 expression increased significantly with disease progression from 3.2% in chronic cervicitis, 19.3% in LSILs and 85.1% in HSILs to 94.4% in CSCCs (P &lt; 0.001).
Knockdown of RIPK4 reduced cell migration and invasion via inhibition of Vimentin, MMP2 and Fibronectin expression in cervical cancer cells.
RIPK4 might act as a potential diagnostic and independent prognostic biomarker for CSCC patients.
We previously showed that protein kinase C-associated kinase (PKK, also known as DIK/RIP4), which belongs to the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinase family, mediates the B cell activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF)-induced NF-KB activation in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines.
Suppression of PKK expression by RNA interference inhibits phosphorylation of IKKAlfa and IKKBeta as well as activation of NF-KB in human cancer cell lines.
We propose that PKK may provide a critical link between IKK activation and various upstream signaling cascades, and may represent a potential target for inhibiting abnormal NF-KB activation in human cancers.
To assess RIPK4 expression in various differentiated TSCC and to determine its basic biological function.
A significantly higher level of RIPK4 was found in well-differentiated TSCC samples than in the poorly differentiated ones (p&lt;0.01).
In the present work we found a correlation between RIPK4 expression and TSCC degree of differentiation, age, and gender.
The better understanding of the molecular mechanism of RIPK4 in TSCC may provide a promising biomarker for tongue cancer prognosis and treatment.
Interestingly, maladaptive ECM remodeling was observed in early AVM without AVD and worsened with late AVD, as evidenced by increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity, as well as abnormalities in ADAMTS-mediated versican processing.
In patients with aortic stenosis or the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, abnormally high levels of shear stress across the stenotic valve or in the microcirculation inflicted with thrombosis may promote cleavage of vWF by ADAMTS13, contributing to the loss of large multimers commonly observed among these patients.
The gene and protein expression profiles and protein distribution of six potential genetic biomarkers (i.e., CAPN6, COL1A2, COL3A1, GALA1, MT2A and MTNR1B) are presented here for both the early and terminal stages of scrapie in five different brain regions.
The distribution of the GALA1 was identified in glial cells from the cerebellum of scrapie-infected animals, GALA1 protein expression was increased in clinical animals in the majority of regions, and the increase of MT2A was in agreement with previous reports.
In conclusion, this study of gene transcription and protein expression and distribution confirm CAPN6, GALA1, MTNR1B and MT2A as potential targets for further prion disease research.
LincRNA-p21 could lead to pulmonary fibrosis in ARDS by inhibition of the expression of Thy-1.
LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis was related with activation of HDAC, deacetylation of histone H3 and H4 and Thy-1 gene silencing.
HDAC inhibitor BA could inhibit LPS-induced pulmonary fibrosis and Thy-1 gene silencing through inhibiting activation of HDAC and deacetylation of histone H4.
SSc patients with pulmonary fibrosis (P = 0.006) and patients with PAH (P &lt; 0.001) had increased sCD90 serum concentrations compared to patients without the respective pulmonary manifestation of SSc.
Osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPGS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterised by congenital blindness and osteoporosis, caused by biallelic mutations in the LRP5 gene.
Molecular genetic examination detected the LRP5 gene for FEVR.
The majority of mutations identified in FEVR are found within four genes that encode the receptor complex (FZD4, LRP5, and TSPAN12) and ligand (NDP) of a molecular pathway that controls angiogenesis, the Norrin-Beta-catenin signaling pathway.
Primers were designed to amplify the coding exons and adjacent intronic regions of the FEVR-causing genes FZD4, LRP5, NDP and TSPAN12.
We identified five LRP5 mutations: three novel heterozygous mutations-p.M181R, p.R399S and p.G503R and two known mutations that were never reported in FEVR patients: p.R494Q and p.G876S.
Surprisingly, we then found mutations in familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) genes; low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 mutations (six families), tetraspanin 12 mutations (two families), and NDP mutations (two families).
Therefore, this study aimed to determine the role of the Mdm2 SNIP 309 polymorphism in the gastric mucosal morphological patterns in patients with Helicobacter pylori associated gastritis.
Therefore, this study aimed to determine the correlation between the patterns of Mdm2 SNIP 309 and the inflammation grading of Helicobacter pylori associated gastritis in a Thai population.
Gastric mucosa from 100 patients with Helicobacter pylori associated gastritis was analyzed for MDM2 SNP309 using real-time PCR hybridization (light-cycler) probes.
While planning genomics, we describe that 11 well-known type 2 diabetes genetic risk variants (in TCF7L2, PPARG-P12A, KCNJ11, FTO, IGF2BP2, DUSP9, CENTD2, THADA, HHEX, CDKAL1, KCNQ1) showed similar associations compared to literature.
Associations between insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) rs11705701, insulin receptor substrate 1 rs7578326, gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor rs10423928 and transcription factor 7-like 2 rs12255372 gene polymorphisms with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have not been evaluated in the Han Chinese population.
A breakdown analysis by gender revealed a significant association of IGF2BP2 rs11705701 with prediabetes under the dominant genetic model in females following application of the Bonferroni correction (odds ratio = 0.26; 95% confidence interval = 0.10-0.67; P=0.005).
The present case-control study reveals a significant association between IGF2BP2 rs11705701 and prediabetes in female patients.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) found that IGF2BP2 rs4402960 and rs1470579 polymorphisms were associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk.
Decreased expression of CHC1L is linked to pathogenesis and progression of both prostate cancer and multiple myeloma.
Recent studies of the RAN (6p21), ZHX-2 (8q24.3), CHC1L (13q14.3) loci highlight the importance of these genes in multiple myeloma (MM) prognosis and therapeutic applications.
Low expression levels of RAN, ZHX-2, and CHC1L were observed in myeloma patients, compared with peripheral blood lymphocytes and MOLP-8 cells.
RAN, ZHX2 and RCBTB2 (CHC1L) expression was evaluated by quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in plasma cells from 85 monoclonal gammopathies: 58 symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) (52 untreated, six relapsed), eight smouldering MM, five monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, four plasma cell leukaemias and 10 myeloid cell lines.
BCCIP deficiency impaired embryonic and postnatal neural development, causing severe ataxia, cerebral and cerebellar defects, and microcephaly.
Phosphorylation also links HS1 to multiple signaling proteins, including Lck, PLCgamma1, and Vav1, and is essential for the stable recruitment of Vav1 to the IS.
On the other hand, we confirmed previously mapped Lck SH3 binding sites in ADAM15, HS1, SLP76, and NS5A, and identified putative Lck SH3 binding sites of Sam68, FasL, c-Cbl, and Cbl-b.
The SH2 domains of ZAP70, SHP-1 and PLC gamma 1 and the SH3 domains of lck, vav and HS1 did not bind to pp85--90.
These analyses identified several cellular proteins inside HIV-1: elongation factor 1alpha, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, HS-1, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein, Pin1, Lck, Nm23-H1, and the C-terminal tail of CD43.
We find that the Src homology 3 domains of Grb2 directly associate, in vitro and in vivo, with murine hemopoietic specific protein 1 (HS1), a protein identical to Lck-binding protein 1.
Because HS1 associates with the p56(lck) and p59(lyn) tyrosine kinases in vitro and in vivo, and becomes tyrosine phosphorylated upon various receptor stimulations, our present data suggest that HS1 mediates linkage between Lck or Lyn and Grb2 in lymphoid lineage cells.
With this method, we previously isolated an Lck tyrosine kinase-associated protein, LckBP1, which is identical to HS1 (Kitamura et al., 1989, 1995; Takemoto et al., 1995).
We have previously found that purine-rich element binding protein, PURalpha, was significantly repressed in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines in comparison to an androgen-dependent line.
Moreover, over-expressing PURalpha in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells attenuated their cell proliferation.
These findings suggest that regulation of PURalpha expression in prostate cancer cells may serve as a therapeutic target for hormone refractory prostate cancer.
We investigated the effects of the DNA damage-inducing cancer chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin on mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from PURA(-/-) knockout mice that lack Puralpha.
Moreover, PURalpha was decreased in its expression both at the protein and mRNA levels in the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and DU145 in comparison to LNCaP cells.
Frequent SIs were pneumonia (15.9%), cellulitis (9.9%), and sepsis (5.0%).
We additionally show that pulmonary fibrosis in MyD88-KO mice was associated with the accumulation of pro-fibrotic regulatory T lymphocytes (T regs) and pro-fibrotic cytokine expression (TGF-Beta, IL-10 and PDGF-B), not with T helper (Th) 17 cell influx.
The aim of our investigation was to analyze the pattern of interleukin-1 (IL-1) family compounds: IL-1 beta, IL-1 receptor accessory protein (Acp), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and IL-1 receptor type II (IL-1RII) in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 67 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 31 controls.

Jeune's asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD) is an autosomal recessive disorder with symptoms of retinal degeneration, kidney cysts, and chondrodysplasia and results from mutations in the ift80 gene.
IL-33 is associated with a variety of autoimmune diseases, such as sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.
IL-33 was significantly higher in BD patients (101.2+/-20.1pg/ml) as compared to healthy controls (31.5+/-10.5 pg/ml) but lower than rheumatoid arthritis patients (132.5+/-19.1 pg/ml).
It has been shown that the administration of interleukin-33 exacerbates collagen-induced arthritis in experimental models, and a positive correlation between cytokine concentrations in serum and synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and disease activity was found.
This review discusses evidence for the role of interleukin-33 with a focus on rheumatoid arthritis.
The antigenic protein spots reacted against sera from clonorchiasis patients and were identified as cysteine proteases, glutathione transferases, gelsolin, propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), prohibitin and 14-3-3 protein (14-3-3) using LC-coupled ESI-MS/MS and an EST database for C. sinensis.
To report the effect of intravitreal bevacizumab in type 2 idiopathic macular telangiectasia (type 2 IMT).
To identify the possible biological roles of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-Beta) in cyclosporine-A (CsA) and phenytoin (PNT)-induced gingival overgrowth (GO) and to correlate them with each other.
Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and scatter factor (SF) are fibroblast-derived growth factors with potent mitogenic and motogenic effects on epithelial cells, and, therefore, could be involved in the pathogenesis of gingival overgrowth.
These results suggest that KGF and SF may have an important role in cyclosporin-induced gingival overgrowth.
On return to the district to calve, 54% of calves from herd 1 and 30% of calves from herd 2 were affected with congenital arthrogryposis or hydranencephaly caused by Akabane virus infection.
Twelve patients with classic radiologic and histologic features of MO, 6 with brown tumors, and 5 with cherubism diagnosed at our institution were studied for the presence of USP6 rearrangements using fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes flanking the USP6 locus on chromosome 17p13.
None of the patients with brown tumor or cherubism demonstrated USP6 rearrangements.
In contrast, no USP6 rearrangements were found in patients with cherubism or brown tumor, supporting the prevailing view that these lesions are distinct biologic entities.
Consistent with findings in mice, marked alterations in nuclear envelope morphology, abnormal localization of RanGAP1, and nuclear accumulation of mRNA were found in cortex of Huntington's disease patients.
Double immunofluorescent analyses revealed nuclear retention and apparent colocalization of RanGap1 with Nup205, Gp210 with Nup205, and partial colocalization of Nup205 with Nup107; most of the ischemic changes above were similar to those observed in patients with C9orf72-genetic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
Detection of the expression of these proteins and genes encoding these proteins in human gastric cancer tissues by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot revealed that the expression of Beta-ACTIN, LDH, DLD, PRPF19 and CaM genes were up-regulated and RanGAP was down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and/or metastatic lymph nodes compared to peri-cancerous tissues.
Stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) patients scheduled for PCI were randomized to one of the three study arms: 1) genotyping, 2) PFT, and 3) control and evaluated by the CYP2C19 allele genotyping and PFT with P2Y12 assay.
To assess the association of CYP2C19 G681A, P2RY12 H1/H2, and ITGB3 T1565C polymorphisms with the extent of platelet aggregation in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) during antiplatelet therapy.
This shortening of the HuR mRNA 3'-UTR via alternative polyadenylation (APA) was observed to be dependent on cleavage stimulation factor subunit 2 (CSTF2/CstF-64), which is up-regulated in the TAMR breast cancer cells.
Moreover, CSTF2, POLA1, HMOX2, and EFNB2 may be associated with the prognosis of bladder cancer patient.
Accordingly, RNAi-induced silencing of CSTF2 decreased the proliferative rate of cancer cells.
Immunohistochemical staining using tissue microarray consisting of 327 lung cancers was applied to examine the expression of CSTF2 protein and its prognostic value.
A role of CSTF2 in cancer cell growth was examined by siRNA experiments.
Immunohistochemical analysis using tissue microarray showed an association of strong CSTF2 expression with poor prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (P = 0.0079), and multivariate analysis showed that CSTF2 positivity is an independent prognostic factor.
In addition, suppression of CSTF2 expression by siRNAs suppressed lung cancer cell growth, whereas exogenous expression of CSTF2 promoted growth and invasion of mammalian cells.
Immunohistochemistry analysis of cellular immune parameters (CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, CIITA, MHC-II and CD68) was performed on NMU-induced rat mammary tumor nodules, followed by evaluation of the serum level of 34 cytokines using the cytokine antibody array.
Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine PD-L1 tumor cell expression and to enumerate CD8, CD4 and CD68 tumor-infiltrating leucocytes (TIL) in a cohort of 443 breast cancers categorized by molecular subtype.
These findings demonstrate, for the first time, a novel capacity of a P-Alexa647-FA conjugate to colocalize to CD11b+CD68+ TAMs in both primary and metastatic breast tumors.
We used breast tumor tissues from each patient to make tissue microarrays that were then stained for leukocyte and myeloid markers including CD4, CD8, CD20, CD25, CD68, and CD163 using immunohistochemical techniques.
Furthermore, high density of CD163+ and CD68+ TAMs was observed in ovarian cancer with advanced TNM stage.
The number of CD68+CD163+ M2-like macrophages was significantly higher in breast cancer tissues than in benign tissues.
