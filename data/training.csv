PRINS,ICD10:N17,RANTES (Regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), recruits circulating leukocytes and augments inflammatory responses in many clinical conditions. Inflammatory responses in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) significantly affect the unfavorable outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI), and that infiltrating immune cells are important mediators of AKI. However, the significance of RANTES in AKI and whether hypoxia-induced LncRNAs are involved in the regulatory process of AKI are not known. Here we show that, in the kidney IRI mice model, significant RANTES expression was observed in renal tubular cells of wild type mice. RANTES deficient (RANTES(-/-)) mice showed better renal function by reducing the acute tubular necrosis, serum creatinine levels, infiltration of inflammatory cells and cytokine expressions compared to wild type. In vitro, we found that RANTES expression was regulated by NF-KB. Further, renal tubular cells showed deregulated LncRNA expression under hypoxia. Among HIF-1Alfa dependent LncRNAs, PRINS (Psoriasis susceptibility-related RNA Gene Induced by Stress) was significantly up regulated in hypoxic conditions and had specific interaction with RANTES as confirmed through reporter assay. These observations show first evidence for RANTES produced by renal tubular cells act as a key chemokine in AKI and HIF-1Alfa regulated LncRNA-PRINS might be involved in RANTES production.PLCD3,Disease,Phospholipase C (PLC) is a pivotal enzyme in the phosphoinositide pathway that promotes the second messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), to participate in eukaryotic signal transduction. Several PLC isozymes are associated with cancer, such as PLC-Beta1, PLC-Delta1, PLC-Epsilon and PLC-Gamma1. However, the role of PLC-Delta3 (PLCD3) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has not been investigated to date. In our previous study, we demonstrated that flotillin2 (Flot2) plays a pro-neoplastic role in NPC and is involved in tumour progression and metastasis. In the present study, we screened the interacting proteins of Flot2 using the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) method and verified the interaction between PLCD3 and Flot2 by co-immunoprecipitation. We also investigated the biological functions of PLCD3 in NPC. Inhibition of PLCD3 expression impaired the malignant potential of 5-8F, a highly metastatic NPC cell line, by restraining its growth, proliferation, mobility and migration. The present study demonstrated that PLCD3 may be an oncogenic protein in NPC and that it plays an important role in the progression of NPC partially by interacting with Flot2.PLCD3,Disease,Transient Receptor Potential Canonical (TRPC) proteins form nonselective cation channels commonly known to be activated downstream from receptors that signal through phospholipase C (PLC). Although TRPC3/C6/C7 can be directly activated by diacylglycerols produced by PLC breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), the mechanism by which the PLC pathway activates TRPC4/C5 remains unclear. We show here that TRPC4 activation requires coincident stimulation of Gi/o subgroup of G proteins and PLCDelta, with a preference for PLCDelta1 over PLCDelta3, but not necessarily the PLCBeta pathway commonly thought to be involved in receptor-operated TRPC activation. In HEK293 cells coexpressing TRPC4 and Gi/o-coupled my opioid receptor, my agonist elicited currents biphasically, with an initial slow phase preceding a rapidly developing phase. The currents were dependent on intracellular Ca(2+) and PIP2. Reducing PIP2 through phosphatases abolished the biphasic kinetics and increased the probability of channel activation by weak Gi/o stimulation. In both HEK293 cells heterologously expressing TRPC4 and renal carcinoma-derived A-498 cells endogenously expressing TRPC4, channel activation was inhibited by knocking down PLCDelta1 levels and almost completely eliminated by a dominant-negative PLCDelta1 mutant and a constitutively active RhoA mutant. Conversely, the slow phase of Gi/o-mediated TRPC4 activation was diminished by inhibiting RhoA or enhancing PLCDelta function. Our data reveal an integrative mechanism of TRPC4 on detection of coincident Gi/o, Ca(2+), and PLC signaling, which is further modulated by the small GTPase RhoA. This mechanism is not shared with the closely related TRPC5, implicating unique roles of TRPC4 in signal integration in brain and other systems.PLCD3,Disease,Rare de novo and inherited copy number variations (CNVs) have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk. However, the genetic underpinnings of ASD remain unknown in more than 80% of cases. Therefore, identification of novel candidate genes and corroboration of known candidate genes may broaden the horizons of determining genetic risk alleles, and subsequent development of diagnostic testing. Here, using genotyping arrays, we characterized the genetic architecture of rare CNVs (&lt;1% frequency) in a Finnish case-control dataset. Unsurprisingly, ASD cases harbored a significant excess of rare, large (&gt;1 Mb) CNVs and rare, exonic CNVs. The exonic rare de novo CNV rate (~22.5%) seemed higher compared to previous reports. We identified several CNVs in well-known ASD regions including GSTM1-5, DISC1, FHIT, RBFOX1, CHRNA7, 15q11.2, 15q13.2-q13.3, 17q12, and 22q11.21. Additionally, several novel candidate genes (BDKRB1, BDKRB2, AP2M1, SPTA1, PTH1R, CYP2E1, PLCD3, F2RL1, UQCRC2, LILRB3, RPS9, and COL11A2) were identified through gene prioritization. The majority of these genes belong to neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathways, and calcium signaling pathways, thus suggesting that a subset of these novel candidate genes may contribute to ASD risk. Furthermore, several metabolic pathways like caffeine metabolism, drug metabolism, retinol metabolism, and calcium-signaling pathway were found to be affected by the rare exonic ASD CNVs. Additionally, biological processes such as bradykinin receptor activity, endoderm formation and development, and oxidoreductase activity were enriched among the rare exonic ASD CNVs. Overall, our findings may add data about new genes and pathways that contribute to the genetic architecture of ASD.PLCD3,Disease,To provide an updated review on current genetic aspects possibly affecting essential hypertension (EH), and to further elucidate their role in EH. We searched for genetic and epigenetic factors in major studies associated with EH between Jan 2008-Oct 2013 using PubMed. We limited our search to reviews that discussed mostly human studies, and were accessible through the university online resource. We found 11 genome wide association studies (GWAS), as well as five methylation and three miRNA studies that fit our search criteria. A distinction was not made between genes with protective effects or negative effects, as this article is only meant to be a summary of genes associated with any aspect of EH. We found 130 genes from the studies that met our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of note, genes with multiple study references include: STK39, CYP17A1, MTHFR-NPPA, MTHFR-NPPB, ATP2B1, CSK, ZNF652, UMOD, CACNB2, PLEKHA7, SH2B3, TBX3-TBX5, ULK4, CSK-ULK3, CYP1A2, NT5C2, CYP171A, PLCD3, SH2B3, ATXN2, CACNB2, PLEKHA7, SH2B3, TBX3-TBX5, ULK4, and HFE. The following genes overlapped between the genetic studies and epigenetic studies: WNK4 and BDKRB2. Several of the identified genes were found to have functions associated with EH. Many epigenetic factors were also correlated with EH. Of the epigenetic factors, there were no articles discussing siRNA and its effects on EH that met the search criteria, thus the topic was not included in this review. Among the miRNA targets found to be associated with EH, many of the genes involved were also identified in the GWAS studies. Genetic hypertension risk algorithms could be developed in the future but may be of limited benefit due to the multi-factorial nature of EH. With emerging technologies, like next-generation sequencing, more direct causal relationships between genetic and epigenetic factors affecting EH will likely be discovered creating a tremendous potential for personalized medicine using pharmacogenomics.PLCD3,Disease,Phospholipase C (PLC) is a key enzyme in phosphoinositide turnover. Among 13 PLC isozymes, PLCDelta1 and PLCDelta3 share high sequence homology and similar tissue distribution, and are expected to have functional redundancy in many tissues. We previously reported that the simultaneous loss of PLCDelta1 and PLCDelta3 caused embryonic lethality because of excessive apoptosis and impaired vascularization of the placenta. Prenatal death of PLCDelta1/PLCDelta3 double-knockout mice hampered our investigation of the roles of these genes in adult animals. Here, we generated PLCDelta1/PLCDelta3 double-knockout mice that expressed PLCDelta1 in extra-embryonic tissues (cDKO mice) to escape embryonic lethality. The cDKO mice were born at the expected Mendelian ratio, which indicated that the simultaneous loss of PLCDelta1 and PLCDelta3 in the embryo proper did not impair embryonic development. However, half of the cDKO mice died prematurely. In addition, the surviving cDKO mice spontaneously showed cardiac abnormalities, such as increased heart weight/tibial length ratios, impaired cardiac function, cardiac fibrosis, dilation, and hypertrophy. Predating these abnormalities, excessive apoptosis of their cardiomyocytes was observed. In addition, siRNA-mediated simultaneous silencing of PLCDelta1 and PLCDelta3 increased apoptosis in differentiated-H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. Activation of Akt and protein kinase C (PKC) Theta was impaired in the hearts of the cDKO mice. siRNA-mediated simultaneous silencing of PLCDelta1 and PLCDelta3 also decreased activated Akt and PKCTheta in differentiated-H9c2 cardiomyoblasts. These results indicate that PLCDelta1 and PLCDelta3 are required for cardiomyocyte survival and normal cardiac function.PLCD3,Disease,Diarrhea is part of the postlaparoscopic cholecystectomy syndrome, but is not well defined. Published reports have ignored possible associated factors such as the preoperative excretion pattern, gastrointestinal disorders, personality disorders, the effect of drugs, unsanitary food, and high-fat diets. The aim of this study was to define the associated factors and predictors of postlaparoscopic cholecystectomy diarrhea (PLCD) at different time intervals after the operation and to identify the possible associated factors and predictors of PLCD. We also aimed to determine the effectiveness of a low-fat diet in these patients and to educate the patients about their diet after the operation. Data were obtained from clinical records and preoperative interviews with patients, who were also interviewed or contacted by telephone 1 week after the operation, and then surveyed by telephone 3 months later using standardized questionnaires. A total of 125 consecutive patients who were adequately informed and who had assented to accepting a prescription of a low-fat diet after undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy participated in this prospective study. Thirty-eight patients (25.2%) had diarrhea 1 week after laparoscopic cholecystectomy and seven patients (5.7%) had diarrhea 3 months after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The important predictors of PLCD at 1 week were a low-fat diet (B = -0.177, p = 0.000) and a high score on a preoperative diarrhea scale (B = 0.311, p = 0.031). There was no predictor for PLCD 3 months after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We advise patients who have undergone laparoscopic cholecystectomy to follow a low-fat diet for at least 1 week to reduce the possibility of diarrhea, especially when they are &lt;=45 years of age, of male sex, and had a high preoperative tendency for diarrhea.PLCD3,Disease,Inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate (IP(3)) and diacylglycerol (DAG) are important intracellular signalling molecules in various tissues. They are generated by the phospholipase C family of enzymes, of which phospholipase C delta (PLCD) forms one class. Studies with functional inactivation of Plcd isozyme encoding genes in mice have revealed that loss of both Plcd1 and Plcd3 causes early embryonic death. Inactivation of Plcd1 alone causes loss of hair (alopecia), whereas inactivation of Plcd3 alone has no apparent phenotypic effect. To investigate a possible synergy of Plcd1 and Plcd3 in postnatal mice, novel mutations of these genes compatible with life after birth need to be found. We characterise a novel mouse mutant with a spontaneously arisen mutation in Plcd3 (Plcd3(mNab)) that resulted from the insertion of an intracisternal A particle (IAP) into intron 2 of the Plcd3 gene. This mutation leads to the predominant expression of a truncated PLCD3 protein lacking the N-terminal PH domain. C3H mice that carry one or two mutant Plcd3(mNab) alleles are phenotypically normal. However, the presence of one Plcd3(mNab) allele exacerbates the alopecia caused by the loss of functional Plcd1 in Del(9)olt1Pas mutant mice with respect to the number of hair follicles affected and the body region involved. Mice double homozygous for both the Del(9)olt1Pas and the Plcd3(mNab) mutations survive for several weeks and exhibit total alopecia associated with fragile hair shafts showing altered expression of some structural genes and shortened phases of proliferation in hair follicle matrix cells. The Plcd3(mNab) mutation is a novel hypomorphic mutation of Plcd3. Our investigations suggest that Plcd1 and Plcd3 have synergistic effects on the murine hair follicle in specific regions of the body surface.PLCD3,Disease,We aimed to test whether eight common recently identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), strongly associated with blood pressure (BP) in the population, also have impact on the degree of BP reduction by antihypertensive agents with different mechanisms. In 3863 Swedish hypertensive patients, we related number of unfavorable alleles of each SNP (i.e. alleles associated with higher baseline BP) to the magnitude of BP reduction during 6 months of monotherapy with either a beta-blocker, a thiazide diuretic or diltiazem. For six SNPs (rs16998073, rs1378942, rs3184504, rs1530440, rs16948048, rs17367504) no pharmacogenetic interactions were suggested, whereas two SNPs showed nominal evidence of association with treatment response: PLCD3-rs12946454 associated with more SBP (beta = 1.53 mmHg per unfavorable allele; P = 0.010) and DBP (beta = 0.73 mmHg per unfavorable allele; P = 0.014) reduction in patients treated with diltiazem, in contrast to those treated with beta-blockers or diuretics wherein no treatment response association was found. CYP17A1-rs11191548 associated with less DBP reduction (beta = -1.26 mmHg per unfavorable allele; P = 0.018) in patients treated with beta-blockers or diuretics, whereas there was no treatment response association in diltiazem-treated patients. However, if accounting for multiple testing, the significant associations for rs12946454 and rs11191548 were attenuated. For a majority of these, eight recently identified BP-associated SNPs, there are probably no important pharmacogenetic interactions for BP reduction with use of beta-blockers, diuretics or diltiazem. Whether the nominally significant associations for rs12946454 and rs11191548 are true signals and could be of possible clinical relevance for deciding treatment of polygenic essential hypertension should be further tested.PLCD3,Disease,The aim of our study was to discover genomic variations related to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) susceptibility. A genome-wide association analysis with most vCJD samples available in the world was performed. A series of 93 vCJD UK patients and 1504 UK controls were included in the discovery stage. Our best findings were replicated in an independent population of 22 UK and 20 French vCJD cases. Post hoc analysis to assess our main results included 5711 French controls, 445 Dutch controls, and 446 sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) cases. We found 2 genome wide significant variants tagging PRNP: rs6107516 (p = 2.6 x 10(-18)) and rs2065706 (p = 8.8 x 10(-14)). Two other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs4921542 and rs7565981) were successfully replicated in independent samples and reached genome-wide significance after pooling discovery and replication populations. Rs4921542 (p = 1.6 x 10(-8)) is an intronic variant in the myotubularin related protein 7 gene (MTMR7), which is specifically expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and inositol 1,3-bisphosphate. Rs7565981 (p = 4.2 x 10(-8)) is in an intergenic region upstream of the neuronal PAS (per-ARNT-sim) domain-containing protein 2 gene (NPAS2), a regulatory gene belonging to a family of transcription factors that has been implicated in memory, seasonal affective disorder, and the molecular clock in the mammalian forebrain. A proxy of rs7565981 (rs17024792; r(2) = 1.0) has been found to regulate the phospholipase C-delta-3 gene (PLCD3) in trans. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Our study reveals 2 new genome-wide significant markers for vCJD outside PRNP and provides evidence supporting a role of the phosphatidylinositol pathway in vCJD susceptibility.PLCD3,Disease,Visceral fat accumulation has an important role in increasing the morbidity and mortality rates, by increasing the risk of developing several metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension. New genetic loci that are associated with increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures have been identified by genome-wide association studies in Caucasian populations. This study investigates whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that confer susceptibility to high blood pressure are also associated with visceral fat obesity. We genotyped 1279 Japanese subjects (556 men and 723 women) who underwent computed tomography for measuring the visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) at the following SNPs: FGF5 rs16998073, CACNB2 rs11014166, C10orf107 rs1530440, CYP17A1 rs1004467, NT5C2 rs11191548, PLEKHA7 rs381815, ATP2B1 rs2681472 and rs2681492, ARID3B rs6495112, CSK rs1378942, PLCD3 rs12946454, and ZNF652 rs16948048. In an additive model, risk alleles of the CYP17A1 rs1004467 and NT5C2 rs11191548 were found to be significantly associated with reduced SFA (P=0.00011 and 0.0016, respectively). When the analysis was performed separately in men and women, significant associations of rs1004467 (additive model) and rs11191548 (recessive model) with reduced VFA (P=0.0018 and 0.0022, respectively) and SFA (P=0.00039 and 0.00059, respectively) were observed in women, but not in men. Our results suggest that polymorphisms in the CYP17A1 and NT5C2 genes influence a reduction in both visceral and subcutaneous fat mass in Japanese women.OTC,Mucoepidermoid carcinoma,The (triamidoamine)uranium chloride complex [{U(NN(3))(&amp;mgr;-Cl)}(2)] [NN(3) = N(CH(2)CH(2)NSiMe(3))(3)] reacts with alkali metal alkoxides and aryloxides to give a range of complexes [U(NN(3))(OR)] (R = Bu(t), t-C(4)F(9), Ph, 2,6-Bu(t)(2)-4-MeC(6)H(2)). Crystallographic investigations (including the molecular structure of the perfluoro-tert-butoxido derivative [U(NN(3))(O-t-C(4)F(9))]), molecular weight determinations, and NMR spectroscopic data are consistent with these molecules being monomeric with a 3-fold symmetric arrangement of the triamidoamine fragment. The three turquoise ate complexes [U(NN(3))(OR)(OR')Li(THF)(n)()] (R, R' = Bu(t) or Ph), are prepared by reaction of the corresponding uranium alkoxides with lithium phenoxide or tert-butoxide. The complex with R = Ph, R' = Bu(t), n = 1 is shown by X-ray crystallography to have a capped trigonal bipyramidal structure. A lithium atom is incorporated into the ligand sphere by coordination to an amido nitrogen and a tert-butoxido oxygen. The mixed alkoxide ate complex [U(NN(3))(OBu(t))(OPh)Li(THF)] gives only [U(NN(3))(OBu(t))] on heating in vacuo. The one-electron oxidation of these ate complexes to the three neutral pentavalent compounds [U(NN(3))(OR)(OR')] (R, R' = Bu(t) or Ph) has been characterized by cyclic voltammetric studies and performed on the chemical scale by reaction with [FeCp(2)][PF(6)].ENSG00000250349,Lymphoblastic leukemia,Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in Western countries. The frequency of symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) involvement is unknown but thought to be a rare phenomenon. Currently there are no known risk factors for CNS involvement. We describe a clinically staged low-risk CLL case that presented with symptomatic CNS involvement and progressed rapidly to death. Evaluation of the surface adhesion molecules identified a markedly altered expression pattern of the integrin, CD49d, and the tetraspanin, CD82, in the index case when compared to similar low-risk CLL cases. We found that the early Rai clinical stage CLL patients showed linear correlation for the co-expression of CD82 and CD49d. In contrast, this unique index case with CNS involvement, which has the same Rai clinical stage, had a significantly lower expression of CD82 and higher expression of CD49d. These data suggest that the expression profile of CD49d and CD82 may represent potential biomarkers for patients with increased propensity of CNS involvement. Moreover, this study illustrates the critical need for a better mechanistic understanding of how specific adhesion proteins regulate the interactions between CLL cells and various tissue sites.ENSG00000250349,Lymphoblastic leukemia,CD9, a member of the tetraspanin family, has been implicated in hematopoietic and leukemic stem cell homing. We investigated the role of CD9 in the dissemination of B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells, by stably downregulating CD9 in REH and NALM6 cells. CD9 expression was associated with higher levels of REH cell adhesion to fibronectin and C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-mediated migration. Death occurred later in NOD/SCID mice receiving REH cells depleted of CD9 for transplantation than in mice receiving control cells. After C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) stimulation, CD9 promoted the formation of long cytoplasmic actin-rich protrusions. We demonstrated that CD9 enhanced RAC1 activation, in both REH cells and blasts from patients. Conversely, the overexpression of a competing CD9 C-terminal tail peptide in REH cytoplasm decreased RAC1 activation and cytoplasmic extension formation in response to CXCL12. Finally, the inhibition of RAC1 activation decreased migration in vitro, and the depletion of RAC1 protein from transplanted REH cells increased mouse survival. Furthermore, a testis-conditioned medium induced the migration of REH and NALM6 cells, and this migration was impeded by an anti-CD9 antibody. The level of CD9 expression also influenced the homing of these cells in mouse testes. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, that CD9 plays a key role in the CXCR4-mediated migration and engraftment of B-ALL cells in the bone marrow or testis, through RAC1 activation.ENSG00000250349,Lymphoblastic leukemia,CD37 is a tetraspanin expressed on malignant B cells. Recently, CD37 has gained interest as a therapeutic target. We developed AGS67E, an antibody-drug conjugate that targets CD37 for the potential treatment of B/T-cell malignancies. It is a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody (AGS67C) conjugated, via a protease-cleavable linker, to the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). AGS67E induces potent cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and cell-cycle alterations in many non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell lines and patient-derived samples in vitro. It also shows potent antitumor activity in NHL and CLL xenografts, including Rituxan-refractory models. During profiling studies to confirm the reported expression of CD37 in normal tissues and B-cell malignancies, we made the novel discovery that the CD37 protein was expressed in T-cell lymphomas and in AML. AGS67E bound to &gt;80% of NHL and T-cell lymphomas, 100% of CLL and 100% of AML patient-derived samples, including CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemic stem cells. It also induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and cell-cycle alterations in AML cell lines and antitumor efficacy in orthotopic AML xenografts. Taken together, this study shows not only that AGS67E may serve as a potential therapeutic for B/T-cell malignancies, but it also demonstrates, for the first time, that CD37 is well expressed and a potential drug target in AML.ENSG00000250349,Lymphoblastic leukemia,Immunotherapy using mAbs is a safe and effective method for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other lymphoid malignancies. In recent years, mAbs based on selective B-cell depletion - rituximab, ofatumumab and obinutuzumab - have been approved for use in CLL therapy. More recently, CD37, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily of cell surface antigens, has been considered as a target for B-cell malignancies. The results of preclinical and early clinical studies suggest that in patients with CLL, newer anti-CD37 agents, otlertuzumab (formerly known as TRU-016), BI 836826, IMGN529 and (177)Lu-tetulomab can be useful in the treatment of this disease. CD37 may offer advantages over CD20 as a target for CLL cells. It is selectively expressed on normal mature B cells and by most B-cell malignancies. Anti-CD37 antibodies may be useful for patients resistant or refractory to anti-CD20 mAb therapy or relapsing after such treatment. The development of these agents into a clinically useful therapy for CLL is probably many years away and will be followed with great interest by laboratory investigators and clinicians.ENSG00000250349,Lymphoblastic leukemia,Therapeutic regimens for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have increasingly utilized monoclonal antibodies since the chimeric anti-CD20 antibody rituximab was introduced. Despite improved clinical outcomes, current CLL therapies are not curative. Therefore, antibodies with greater efficacy and novel targets are desirable. One promising target is CD37, a tetraspanin protein highly expressed on malignant B-cells in CLL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Although several novel CD37-directed therapeutics are emerging, detailed preclinical evaluation of these agents is limited by lack of appropriate animal models with spontaneous leukemia expressing the human CD37 (hCD37) target. To address this, we generated a murine CLL model that develops transplantable hCD37+ leukemia. Subsequently, we engrafted healthy mice with this leukemia to evaluate IMGN529, a novel hCD37-targeting antibody-drug conjugate. IMGN529 rapidly eliminated peripheral blood leukemia and improved overall survival. In contrast, the antibody component of IMGN529 could not alter disease course despite exhibiting substantial in vitro cytotoxicity. Furthermore, IMGN529 is directly cytotoxic to human CLL in vitro, depletes B-cells in patient whole blood and promotes killing by macrophages and natural killer cells. Our results demonstrate the utility of a novel mouse model for evaluating anti-human CD37 therapeutics and highlight the potential of IMGN529 for treatment of CLL and other CD37-positive B-cell malignancies.ENSG00000250349,Lymphoblastic leukemia,TRU-016 is a SMIP(TM) (monospecific protein therapeutic) molecule against the tetraspanin transmembrane family protein CD37 that is currently in Phase 2 trials in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). In an attempt to enhance the ADCC function of SMIP-016, the chimeric version of TRU-016, SMIP-016(GV) was engineered with a modification in a glycosylation site in the Fc domain. The wild-type and glycovariant SMIP proteins mediate comparable Type I antibody-like direct cytotoxicity in the presence of anti-human Fc crosslinker and show a similar tyrosine phosphorylation pattern post-treatment. However, NK cells stimulated with the SMIP-016(GV) exhibit enhanced activation and release 3-fold more interferon-Gamma compared with SMIP-016. SMIP-016(GV) shows enhanced ADCC function against cells expressing CD37 with NK cell effectors derived from both normal and CLL-affected individuals. Enhanced ADCC is observed against CLL cells and is sustained at concentrations of SMIP-016(GV) as low at 5E(-6) myg/mL on cells expressing minimal CD37 antigen. In support of the biological relevance of this, SMIP-016(GV) mediates effective ADCC against primary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells with low surface expression of CD37. Collectively, these data suggest potential use of the novel therapeutic agent SMIP-016(GV) with enhanced effector function for B cell malignancies, including CLL and ALL therapy.ENSG00000250349,Lymphoblastic leukemia,Tetraspanin proteins form signaling complexes between them and with other membrane proteins and modulate cell adhesion and migration properties. The surface expression of several tetraspanin antigens (CD9, CD37, CD53, CD63, and CD81), and their interacting proteins (CD19, CD21, and HLA-DR) were analyzed during normal B-cell maturation and compared to a group of 67 B-cell neoplasias. Three patterns of tetraspanin expression were identified in normal B cells. The first corresponded to bone marrow CD10(+) B-cell precursors (BCP) which showed high expression of CD81 and CD9, low reactivity for CD53 and negativity for CD37. CD10(-) B-lymphocytes showed downregulation of CD9/CD81 and upregulation of CD53/CD37. Plasma cells showed re-expressed CD9 and downregulated CD37. Hierarchical clustering analysis of flow cytometry immunophenotypic data showed a good correlation between the tumor differentiation stage and the pattern of tetraspanin expression, with all analyzed individual samples classified into three major groups, independently of their normal or neoplastic origin. Despite this, neoplastic B-cells frequently showed aberrantly high/low expression of the different markers analyzed. Interestingly, in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, abnormal expression of CD53 and CD9 were associated with different patterns of disease infiltration, which would support the role of these molecules on modulating adhesion and migration of neoplastic B cells.ITGAM,ICD10:L43,To clarify the pathogenesis of oral lichen planus (OLP), we investigated the roles of keratinocytes (KC) in mononuclear cell infiltration. When peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy donors were cultured in the presence of culture supernatants of KC separated from the noninflamed gingivae (Nor-KC) and cheek mucosae of patients with OLP (OLP-KC), the number of migrated PBMC across monolayered human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were increased to about 1.3-fold and 1.5-fold of the control level, respectively, with increases of the expression of CD11a, CD11b, CD18, and CD49d on PBMC and intracellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 on HUVEC. The number of migrated PBMC was reduced to about 60% of the control level by pretreatment of PBMC with anti-CD11a or anti-CD18 MAb and reduced to about 70% by pretreatment of HUVEC with anti-CD54 MAb. The pretreatment of PBMC with genistein, H-7, wortmannin, or exoenzyme C3 decreased the migrated PBMC by about 70 to 90%. In agreement with these results, the culture supernatants of OLP-KC up-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation of 62-kDa, 70-kDa, and 102-kDa proteins, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and protein kinase C activities and activated Rho protein level more so than did those of Nor-KC. Additionally, actin reorganization with the formation of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia was distinctly induced by the culture supernatants of OLP-KC. These results indicate that cytokines generated by KC transduce their signals in PBMC, up-regulating the expression of cell surface adhesion molecules and migration activity with reorganization of actin filaments.ITGAM,ICD10:L43,T lymphocytes show a special affinity for the skin. Although the roles played by the CD4+ population of T lymphocytes in immunodermatology were so far actively investigated, much less is known about the roles played in the skin by CD8+ cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL). The activity of CD8+ CTL in the immunodermatological context, however, is likely to be most important; the immuno-biology itself of CD8+ CTL, moreover, although far from being fully understood, shows intriguing characteristics. Immunophenotype, function and cytokine profile of CD8+ CTL are overviewed in the first section of this review. Phenotypically, not only CD8+ CTL can be subdivided into CD8+ CD28+ CD11b- and CD8+ CD28- CD11b+ subsets, but also an up-to-now undetected CD8+ CD28- CD11b- subset does exist. Functionally, not only "cytotoxic" but even "suppressor" subpopulations have been shown to exert cytolytic capabilities indeed, and "suppression" itself may be due to such a lytic capacity. According to cytokine synthesis, CD8+ CTL can be split into Tc1 and Tc2 subsets, each able to influence specific patterns of immune responses. The impact of CD8+ CTL in immunodermatology, overviewed in the second section of the current review, is crucial. The pathophysiology of inflammatory dermatoses is deeply influenced by the activity of CD8+ CTL: e.g., CD8+ CTL within psoriatic epidermis are possibly associated to the persistence of psoriatic lesions not undergoing resolution; on the other hand, in late lesions of lichen planus CD8+ CTL predominate, thus explaining presumably both the cytolytic attack against keratinocytes and the modulation of the inflammatory reaction up to the final resolution of the lesions, Tc1 cells are decreased in atopic dermatitis, and such a decrease can account both for IgE overproduction and for development of infections. Finally, CD8+ CTL can sustain against cutaneous viruses/tumors cytolytic immune responses not only of secondary but even of primary type, i.e. induced by Langerhans cells/dendritic cells either transfected or pulsed with skin virus/tumor-associated antigens, thus allowing the production of vaccines against cutaneous viral/neoplastic diseases.ITGAM,ICD10:L43,Mast cells are bone marrow-derived, ubiquitous connective tissue resident cells. However, their mechanisms of migration, the distribution of immature and mature cells and their interaction with other inflammatory cells are largely unclarified. Possibly, beta 2-integrins play an important role in these processes. In the present investigation, the authors studied the expression and regulation of the beta 2-integrins LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), p150,95 (CD11c/CD18) and of the LFA-1/Mac-1 counter-receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1; CD54) on leukaemic (HMC-1 cell subclone 5C6) and on normal mature human skin mast cells. The HMC-1 cells clearly expressed CD11a, CD18 and CD54, while expression of CD11b and CD11c was low. The apparent molecular weights were 180 kDa (CD11a), 95 kDa (CD18) and 90 kDa (CD54) as determined by Western blot analysis. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induced a time- and dose-dependent up-regulation of CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18 and CD54 that was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting a dependence on de novo protein synthesis. Enhanced expression of CD11a, CD11b, CD11c and CD18 could also be confirmed at the gene level as demonstrated by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Increased expression of LFA-1/ICAM-1 in response to PMA was accompanied by strong enhancement of homotypic cell aggregation, suggesting that newly synthesized LFA-1/ICAM-1 is functionally active. In order to determine a physiologically relevant way of mast cell beta 2-integrin modulation, several cytokines and chemotactic mediators (interleukin-4, IL-4; nerve growth factor beta, NGF beta; C5a; and leukotriene B4, LTB4) were tested for their influence on adhesion molecule cell surface density. Only LTB4 was shown specifically to up-regulate CD11a and CD18, but not CD11b or CD11c. The presence of CD11a, CD11c and CD18 could be confirmed on a low percentage of normal skin mast cells by immunofluorescence, using a double staining technique. In comparison to normal skin, a significantly higher percentage of CD18+ mast cells was found in inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis vulgaris, atopic dermatitis and lichen planus. Therefore, mast cell beta 2-integrins possibly play an important role during homing of immature mast cells as well as during the interaction of activated mast cells with other inflammatory cells.ITGAM,ICD10:L43,The results of several investigations proved that, in special circumstances, human keratinocytes (HKs) synthesize and express cell surface moieties characteristic of effector and/or accessory cells of the immune system, such as CD16, CD36, HLA-DR, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54), which are all detectable on the surfaces of macrophages. In the present study, skin biopsies from healthy volunteers, from positive tuberculin skin tests, and from patients with acute urticaria (AU), lichen planus (LP), psoriasis vulgaris (PV), mycosis fungoides (MF), and purpura pigmentosa chronica (PPC) were investigated by means of a multistep immunoperoxidase method to examine the reactivity of the HKs with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MABs) characteristic of monocyte/macrophage cell lines. In biopsies obtained from positive tuberculin tests and from clinically involved skin of patients with LP, PV, MF, or PPC, a multifocal, positive peroxidase reaction was observed on the membranes of HKs of the basal and suprabasal cell layers when the MABs OKM13 (CD13), OKM14 (CD14), and Dako-Macrophage (CD68) were used. In contrast, specific staining of the HKs was not observed with the same antibodies in the biopsies of healthy volunteers or of patients with AU or in the uninvolved skin specimens obtained from the other patients. The HKs of PV, LP, MF, PPC, and AU patients and those of the healthy subjects all failed to give positive reactions when MABs against CD11b, CD15, or CD33 were used. The published data supplement the known surface characteristics of HKs, reflecting their stage of activation and differentiation.ITGAM,ICD10:L43,Epidermal dendritic cells (DCs) isolated from psoriasis possess greatly enhanced T lymphocyte-activating properties compared with DCs from normal skin, suggesting that DCs in psoriasis express surface antigens crucial for antigen presentation. These include beta 2-integrins and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Our purpose was to determine DC phenotype in psoriatic compared with normal epidermis with respect to these molecules. Tissue sections were single labeled with a peroxidase antiperoxidase (PAP) immunohistochemical technique and double labeled where necessary with a combination of a PAP and an alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase technique. In psoriatic compared with normal skin, decreased numbers of DCs expressed CD1a (p less than 0.05), whereas increased numbers of DCs expressed class II major histocompatibility antigens (p less than 0.05). In normal skin positive staining for CD18 was not observed, whereas in psoriasis both CD1a+ and CD1a- DCs expressed beta 2-integrins, LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), and gp 150/95 (CD11c/CD18). DCs in atopic dermatitis and lichen planus were also found to express beta 2-integrins. Neither MAC 1 (CD11b/CD18) nor ICAM-1 was observed on DCs. These data are consistent with either migration of dendritic antigen-presenting cells into the epidermis or in situ cytokine modulation of Langerhans cell phenotype in inflamed skin. Furthermore, they indicate that epidermal DCs in psoriasis and other cutaneous inflammatory diseases express molecules that are known to be crucial for Langerhans cell-driven T-cell activation in vitro.ITGAM,ICD10:L43,Integrins are cell surface molecules of importance in a wide variety of cellular functions, including morphogenesis, cell migration and cell matrix interactions. The beta-2 (B2) integrin (leukocyte integrin, CD11/CD18) subfamily comprising three members, each consisting of a shared beta subunit (CD18) non-covalently associated with unique alpha subunits (CD11a, CD11b, CD11c). In the present study, we have analysed the expression pattern of B2 integrins on the surface of human keratinocytes (HKs) in biopsies obtained from healthy volunteers, from positive tuberculin skin tests and from patients with acute urticaria (AU), lichen planus (LP), psoriasis vulgaris (PV), mycosis fungoides (MF) or purpura pigmentosa chronica (PPC). In biopsies obtained from positive tuberculin tests and from the clinically involved skin of patients with LP, PV, MF or PPC, a multifocally occurring, suprabasal peroxidase-positive reaction was observed on the membranes of the HKs when the monoclonal antibodies (MABs) Dako CD11a, Dako-p150, 95 or Dako CD18 were used. In contrast, no specific staining of the HKs was observed with the same MABs in biopsies from healthy volunteers, from patients with AU and in the uninvolved skin specimens obtained from the other patients. The HKs from PV, LP, MF, PPC and AU patients and those from the healthy subjects failed to give a positive reaction when the MAB against CD11b (OKM1) was used. Our present findings provide further evidence that HKs may be actively involved in cell adhesion processes.FZD9,Nervous system disease,Congenital hydrocephalus is heterogeneous in its etiology, and in addition to a genetic component, has been shown to be caused by environmental factors. Until now, however, no methylation alterations of target genes have been connected with congenital hydrocephalus in humans. Frizzled 3(FZD3) is a planar cell polarity (PCP) gene required for PCP signaling. Partial restoration of frizzled 3 activities in FZD3 mutant mice results in hydrocephalus. To analyze the possible roles of epigenetic modifications of the FZD3 gene in congenital hydrocephalus pathogenesis, DNA methylation in the promoter region of FZD3 was assayed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Gene expression and chromatin accessibility were also determined to assess the role of methylation alterations. Our study found methylation levels of the FZD3 gene were increased in congenital hydrocephalus, especially in males (10.57 +/- 3.90 vs. 7.08 +/- 0.94, p=0.001). Hypermethylation of FZD3 increased congenital hydrocephalus risk, with an odds ratio of 10.125 (p=0.003). Aberrant methylation modification of FZD3 altered both chromatin structure in this region and FZD3 expression levels. Totally, aberrant methylation modification of the FZD3 gene increases the risk of congenital hydrocephalus by altering chromatin structure and disturbing gene expression.FZD9,Nervous system disease,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor neurons. Familial ALS is strongly associated to dominant mutations in the gene for Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Recent evidences point to skeletal muscle as a primary target in the ALS mouse model. Wnt/PI3 K signaling pathways and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) have important roles in maintenance and repair of skeletal muscle. Wnt/PI3 K pathways and EMT gene expression profile were investigated in gastrocnemius muscle from SOD1(G93A) mouse model and age-paired wild-type control in the presymptomatic ages of 40 and 80 days aiming the early neuromuscular abnormalities that precede motor neuron death in ALS. A customized cDNA microarray platform containing 326 genes of Wnt/PI3 K and EMT was used and results revealed eight up-regulated (Loxl2, Pik4ca, Fzd9, Cul1, Ctnnd1, Snf1lk, Prkx, Dner) and nine down-regulated (Pik3c2a, Ripk4, Id2, C1qdc1, Eif2ak2, Rac3, Cds1, Inppl1, Tbl1x) genes at 40 days, and also one up-regulated (Pik3ca) and five down-regulated (Cd44, Eef2 k, Fzd2, Crebbp, Piki3r1) genes at 80 days. Also, protein-protein interaction networks grown from the differentially expressed genes of 40 and 80 days old mice have identified Grb2 and Src genes in both presymptomatic ages, thus playing a potential central role in the disease mechanisms. mRNA and protein levels for Grb2 and Src were found to be increased in 80 days old ALS mice. Gene expression changes in the skeletal muscle of transgenic ALS mice at presymptomatic periods of disease gave further evidence of early neuromuscular abnormalities that precede motor neuron death. The results were discussed in terms of initial triggering for neuronal degeneration and muscle adaptation to keep function before the onset of symptoms.FZD9,Nervous system disease,Williams Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a multisystemic disorder caused by a hemizygous deletion of 1.5 Mb on chromosome 7q11.23 spanning 28 genes. A few patients with larger and smaller WBS deletion have been reported. They show clinical features that vary between isolated SVAS to the full spectrum of WBS phenotype, associated with epilepsy or autism spectrum behavior. Here we describe four patients with atypical WBS 7q11.23 deletions. Two carry ~3.5 Mb larger deletion towards the telomere that includes Huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1) and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxigenase activation protein gamma (YWHAG) genes. Other two carry a shorter deletion of ~1.2 Mb at centromeric side that excludes the distal WBS genes BAZ1B and FZD9. Along with previously reported cases, genotype-phenotype correlation in the patients described here further suggests that haploinsufficiency of HIP1 and YWHAG might cause the severe neurological and neuropsychological deficits including epilepsy and autistic traits, and that the preservation of BAZ1B and FZD9 genes may be related to mild facial features and moderate neuropsychological deficits. This report highlights the importance to characterize additional patients with 7q11.23 atypical deletions comparing neuropsychological and clinical features between these individuals to shed light on the pathogenic role of genes within and flanking the WBS region.FZD9,Nervous system disease,Sensory peripheral neuropathy is a common and sometimes debilitating toxicity associated with paclitaxel therapy. This study aims to identify genetic risk factors for the development of this toxicity. A prospective pharmacogenetic analysis of patients with primary breast cancer, randomized to the paclitaxel arm of CALGB 40101, was used to identify genetic predictors of the onset and severity of sensory peripheral neuropathy. A genome-wide association study in 855 subjects of European ancestry was conducted and findings were replicated in additional European (n = 154) and African American (n = 117) subjects. A single nucleotide polymorphism in FGD4 was associated with the onset of sensory peripheral neuropathy in the discovery cohort [rs10771973; HR, 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.30-1.91; P = 2.6 x 10(-6)] and in a European (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.06-2.80; P = 0.013) and African American (HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.13-3.28; P = 6.7 x 10(-3)) replication cohort. There is also evidence that markers in additional genes, including EPHA5 (rs7349683) and FZD3 (rs10771973), were associated with the onset or severity of paclitaxel-induced sensory peripheral neuropathy. A genome-wide association study has identified novel genetic markers of paclitaxel-induced sensory peripheral neuropathy, including a common polymorphism in FGD4, a congenital peripheral neuropathy gene. These findings suggest that genetic variation may contribute to variation in development of this toxicity. Validation of these findings may allow for the identification of patients at increased risk of peripheral neuropathy and inform the use of an alternative to paclitaxel and/or the clinical management of this toxicity.FZD9,Nervous system disease,Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the Western world affecting younger, otherwise healthy individuals. Today no curative treatment exists. Patients suffer from recurring attacks caused by demyelination and underlying neuroinflammation, ultimately leading to loss of neurons. Recent research shows that bio-liberation of gold ions from metallic gold implants can ameliorate inflammation, reduce apoptosis and promote proliferation of neuronal stem cells (NSCs) in a mouse model of focal brain injury. Based on these findings, the present study investigates whether metallic gold implants affect the clinical signs of disease progression and the pathological findings in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model of MS. Gold particles 20-45 mym suspended in hyaluronic acid were bilaterally injected into the lateral ventricles (LV) of young Lewis rats prior to EAE induction. Comparing gold-treated animals to untreated and vehicle-treated ones, a statistically significant slowing of disease progression in terms of reduced weight loss was seen. Despite massive inflammatory infiltration, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling staining revealed reduced apoptotic cell death in disease foci in the brain stem of gold-treated animals, alongside an up-regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive reactive astrocytes near the LV and in the brain stem. Cell counting of frizzled-9 and nestin-stained cells showed statistically significant up-regulation of NSCs migrating from the subventricular zone. Additionally, the neuroprotective proteins Metallothionein-1 and -2 were up-regulated in the corpus callosum. In conclusion, this study is the first to show that the presence of small gold implants affect disease progression in a rat model of MS, increasing the neurogenic response and reducing the loss of cells in disease foci. Gold implants might thus improve clinical outcome for MS patients and further research into the long-term effects of such localized gold treatment is warranted.FZD9,Nervous system disease,There is evidence that genetic factors play a role in the complex multifactorial pathogenesis of hydrocephalus. Identification of the genes involved in the development of this neurologic disorder in animal models may elucidate factors responsible for the excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in hydrocephalic humans. The authors report here a brief summary of findings from 12 lines of genetically engineered mice that presented with autosomal recessive congenital hydrocephalus. This study illustrates the value of knockout mice in identifying genetic factors involved in the development of congenital hydrocephalus. Findings suggest that dysfunctional motile cilia represent the underlying pathogenetic mechanism in 8 of the 12 lines (Ulk4, Nme5, Nme7, Kif27, Stk36, Dpcd, Ak7, and Ak8). The likely underlying cause in the remaining 4 lines (RIKEN 4930444A02, Celsr2, Mboat7, and transgenic FZD3) was not determined, but it is possible that some of these could also have ciliary defects. For example, the cerebellar malformations observed in RIKEN 4930444A02 knockout mice show similarities to a number of developmental disorders, such as Joubert, Meckel-Gruber, and Bardet-Biedl syndromes, which involve mutations in cilia-related genes. Even though the direct relevance of mouse models to hydrocephalus in humans remains uncertain, the high prevalence of familial patterns of inheritance for congenital hydrocephalus in humans suggests that identification of genes responsible for development of hydrocephalus in mice may lead to the identification of homologous modifier genes and susceptibility alleles in humans. Also, characterization of mouse models can enhance understanding of important cell signaling and developmental pathways involved in the pathogenesis of hydrocephalus.FZD9,Nervous system disease,The hippocampus is crucial for higher brain functions, such as learning, memory, and emotion. Many diseases like epilepsy and Down's syndrome are associated with abnormalities in early hippocampal development. In addition, adult dentate neurogenesis is thought to be defective in several classes of psychiatric disorders. However, the mechanisms regulating hippocampal development and adult neurogenesis remain unclear. One of the limitations to studying these processes is the scarcity of available specific mouse tools. Here, we report an inducible transgenic Cre mouse line, Frizzled 9-CreER(TM), in which tamoxifen administration induces Cre recombinant. Our data show that Cre is expressed in the developing hippocampal primordium, confined to the granule cell layer at P20 and further limited to the subgranular zone in the adult dentate gyrus. Cre recombinase shows very high activity in all of these regions. Thus, this transgenic line will be a powerful tool in understanding the mechanisms of hippocampal development, adult neurogenesis, and associated diseases.FZD9,Nervous system disease,Ependymal cells form the epithelial lining of cerebral ventricles. Their apical surface is covered by cilia that beat in a coordinated fashion to facilitate circulation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The genetic factors that govern the development and function of ependymal cilia remain poorly understood. We found that the planar cell polarity cadherins Celsr2 and Celsr3 control these processes. In Celsr2-deficient mice, the development and planar organization of ependymal cilia are compromised, leading to defective CSF dynamics and hydrocephalus. In Celsr2 and Celsr3 double mutant ependyma, ciliogenesis is markedly impaired, resulting in lethal hydrocephalus. The membrane distribution of Vangl2 and Fzd3, two key planar cell polarity proteins, was disturbed in Celsr2 mutants, and even more so in Celsr2 and Celsr3 double mutants. Our findings suggest that planar cell polarity signaling is involved in ependymal cilia development and in the pathophysiology of hydrocephalus, with possible implications in other ciliopathies.FZD9,Nervous system disease,Spina bifida, a neural tube closure defect (NTD) involving the posterior portion of what will ultimately give rise to the spinal cord, is one of the most common and serious birth defects. The etiology of spina bifida is thought to be multi-factorial and involve multiple interacting genes and environmental factors. The causes of this congenital malformation remain largely unknown. However, several candidate genes for spina bifida have been identified in lower vertebrates, including the planar cell polarity (PCP) genes. We used data from a case-control study conducted in California to evaluate the association between variation within several key PCP genes and the risk of spina bifida. The PCP genes included in this study were the human homologs of the Xenopus genes Flamingo, Strabismus, Prickle, Dishevelled, and Scrib, two of the homologs of Xenopus Wnt genes, WNT5A and WNT11, and two of the homologs of Xenopus Frizzled, FZD3 and FZD6. None of the 172 SNPs that were evaluated were significantly associated with spina bifida in any racial/ethnic group after correction for multiple testing. However, several SNPs in the PRICKLE2 gene had unadjusted P-value &lt;0.01. In conclusion, our results, though largely negative, suggest that the PRICKLE2 gene may potentially modify the risk of spina bifida and deserves further investigation.FZD9,Nervous system disease,Little is known about signaling pathways, besides those of neurotrophic factors, that are operational in adult spiral ganglion neurons. In patients with sensorineural hearing loss, such pathways could eventually be targeted to stimulate and guide neurite outgrowth from the remnants of the spiral ganglion towards a cochlear implant, thereby improving the fidelity of sound transmission. To systematically identify neuronal receptors for guidance cues in the adult cochlea, we conducted a genome-wide cDNA microarray screen with 2-month-old CBA/CaJ mice. A meta-analysis of our data and those from older mice in two other studies revealed the presence of neuronal transmembrane receptors that represent all four established guidance pathways--ephrin, netrin, semaphorin, and slit--in the mature cochlea as late as 15 months. In addition, we observed the expression of all known receptors for the "wingless-related MMTV integration site" (Wnt) morphogens, whose neuronal guidance function has only recently been recognized. In situ hybridizations located the mRNAs of the Wnt receptors frizzled 1, 4, 6, 9, and 10 specifically in adult spiral ganglion neurons. Finally, frizzled 9 protein was found in the growth cones of adult spiral ganglion neurons that were regenerating neurites in culture. We conclude from our results that adult spiral ganglion neurons are poised to respond to neurite damage, owing to the constitutive expression of a large and diverse collection of guidance receptors. Wnt signaling, in particular, emerges as a candidate pathway for guiding neurite outgrowth towards a cochlear implant after sensorineural hearing loss.MOXD1,Disease of anatomical entity,To observe the influence of suspended moxibustion on neutrophilic asthma related signal factors in asthma rats. Thirty-two SD rats were randomly divided into normal control, model, dexamethasone(DEX) and suspended moxibustion (MOX) groups, with 8 rats in each group. The neutrophil granulocyte asthma model was made by intranasal instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), intraperitoneal injection of ovalbumin(OVA) and inhalation of OVA, once a day for 14 d. After modeling, rats of the DEX group received intraperitoneal injection of DEX (0.5 mg/kg), once daily for 14 d, and those of the MOX group treated by suspended MOX at "Danzhong" (CV 17), and bilateral "Feishu" (BL 13), "Pishu" (BL 20), and "Shen-shu" (BL 23) for 40 min, once a day, for 14 d. The total number of leukocytes and Wright's stain-displayed differential counts in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were counted, and the content of IL-17 in the BALF was assayed by ELISA. The contents of T-helper 17 (Th 17) cells in the spleen and peripheral blood were detected using flow cytometry, and the expression of retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gamma t (ROR-Gammat) mRNA and protein in the inferior lobe of the right lung were detected by quantitative real-time PCR, immunohistochemical stain and Western blot, respectively. Compared with the normal control group, the total number of leukocytes, the percentages of neutrophils, eosinophilis and lymphcytes and IL-17 content in the BALF, and Th 17 contents in the peripheral blood and spleen tissue were significantly increased in the model group (P&lt;0.01). After the treatment, the total numbers of leukocytes, the percentages of neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes and IL-17 contents in the BALF, and Th 17 contents in the peripheral blood and spleen tissues were down-regulated considerably in both the DEX and MOX groups (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01). Immunohistochemical stain, real-time PCR and Western blot measurements showed that the expression levels of ROR-Gammat protein and mRNA in the lung tissues were notably higher in the model group than in the normal control group (P&lt;0.01), and significantly down-regulated in both DEX and MOX groups relevant to the model group (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01). No significant differences were found between the DEX and MOX groups in all the aforementioned indexes (P&lt;0.05), except plasma Th 17 (P&lt;0.05). Suspended moxibustion, being comparable to DEX treatment, can reduce the inflammatory reactions of neutrophilic asthma rats by down-regulating the expression of ROR -Gammat in the lung, and lowering IL-17 and neutrophils levels in the airway, and Th 17 in the peripheral blood and spleen.MOXD1,Disease of anatomical entity,A key aspect of atherosclerosis is the maladaptive inflammatory response to lipoprotein accumulation in the artery. The failure to decrease lipid accumulation, to clear apoptotic cells, and to resolve inflammation ultimately leads to macrophage accumulation within the vascular wall [Thorp EB (2010) Apoptosis15, 1124-1136; Moore K et al. (2013) Nat Rev Immunol 13, 709-721; Moore KJ and Tabas I (2011) Cell 145, 341-355; Ley K et al. (2011) Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol 31, 1506-1516]. Several subsets of macrophages are found inside atherosclerotic plaques [Chinetti-Gbaguidi G et al. (2015) Nat Rev Cardiol 12, 10-17; Leitinger N and Schulman IG (2013) Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol 33, 1120-1126; Mantovani A et al. (2009) Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol 29, 1419-1423]: Proinflammatory M1-like macrophages potentially participate in atherosclerosis initiation and progression; M2-like macrophages are thought to be protective due to their anti-inflammatory and profibrotic properties, presumably stabilizing the plaque [Chistiakov DA et al. (2015) Int J Cardiol 184, 436-445; Gordon S (2003) Nat Rev Immunol 3, 23-35]; Mox macrophages develop in response to oxidized phospholipids and present a glutathione- and potentially redox-regulating phenotype [Kadl A et al. (2010) Circ Res 107, 737-746]; Mhem macrophages are found in areas of plaque hemorrhage [Boyle JJ et al. (2009) Am J Pathol 174, 1097-1108; Boyle JJ et al. (2012) Circ Res 110, 20-33] where they are involved in heme clearance. Recent evidence suggests that the relative abundance of these macrophage subsets is a better indicator of plaque progression and stability than the total number of lesion macrophages [Chinetti-Gbaguidi G et al. (2015) Nat Rev Cardiol 12, 10-17]. Over the last few years, findings in the area of immunometabolism established a link between the metabolic state of the different macrophage phenotypes and their functions [O'Neill LAJ and Pearce EJ (2016) J Exp Med 213, 15-23]. However, the effect of metabolic changes in macrophages on atherosclerotic plaque progression and stability is not well understood and an area of intensive study. In this review, we will summarize and critically discuss recent developments in the field of macrophage metabolism in the context of atherosclerosis to guide future investigation in this area.MOXD1,Disease of anatomical entity,The increasing number of reports of human infections by Strongyloides stercoralis from a range of European countries over the last 20 years has spurred the interest of the scientific community towards this parasite and, in particular, towards the role that infections of canine hosts may play in the epidemiology of human disease. Data on the epidemiology of canine strongyloidiasis is currently limited, most likely because of the inherent limitations of current diagnostic methods. Faecal samples were collected directly from the rectal ampulla of 272 animals of varying age and both genders living in Apulia, southern Italy. Dogs included were either privately owned (n = 210), living in an urban area but with unrestricted outdoor access (Group 1), or shelter dogs (n = 62 out of ~400) hosted in a single shelter in the province of Bari in which a history of diarrhoea, weight loss, reduced appetite and respiratory symptoms had been reported (Group 2). Strongyloides stercoralis infection was diagnosed by coproscopy on direct faecal smear and via the Baermann method. Six of 272 dogs were positive for S. stercoralis at the Baermann examination; all but one were from the shelter (Group 2) and displayed gastrointestinal clinical signs. The only owned dog (Group 1) infected with S. stercoralis, but clinically healthy, had been adopted from a shelter 1 year prior to sampling. Five infected dogs were treated with fenbendazole (Panacur(R), Intervet, Animal Health, 50 mg/kg, PO daily for 5 days), or with a combination of fenbendazole and moxidectin plus imidacloprid spot-on (Im/Mox; Advocate(R) spot-on, Bayer). Post-treatment clearance of infection was confirmed in three dogs by Baermann examination, whereas treatment failure was documented in two dogs by Baermann and/or post-mortem detection of adult parasites. This study describes, for the first time, the presence of S. stercoralis infection in sheltered dogs from southern Italy. Data indicate that S. stercoralis infection may pose a concern for sheltered animals and raise questions on potential risks of infection for staff of municipal shelters in southern European countries. Given that a single course of treatment with fenbendazole, associated or not with Im/Mox spot-on, may not eliminate the infection, effective treatment protocols should be investigated and control strategies targeting the environment considered for reducing the risk of zoonotic infection.MOXD1,Disease of anatomical entity,The authors assessed efficacy of treating patients with atherosclerosis obliterans of lower-limb arteries using the method of walking training. Our prospective study included a total of 84 patients suffering from intermittent claudication. They were divided in two groups. The Study Group (Group I) comprised 64 patients undergoing comprehensive treatment including walking training (WT) and the Control Group (Group II) consisted of 20 patients treated without a physical training programme. The patients were followed up monthly during three months, with registration of the pain-free walking distance (PFWD), maximum walking distance (MWD), and the ankle-brachial index (ABI). There were no baseline statistically significant differences between Group I and Group II patients in the parameters examined. The Study Group patients were found to have a considerable increase in the PFWD and MWD values, with the statistical significance of differences from the Control Group patients observed as early as at one month of treatment. The baseline PFWD value in the Study Group amounted to 132.4+/-14.7 m, being at 3 months 259.7+/-29.6 m (p&lt;0.05); the MWD value in the Study Group initially equalled 170.2+/-12.3 m, amounting at 3 months to 364.6+/-39.2 m (p&lt;0.05). The Study Group patients by the end of follow up were also found to have an increase in the ankle-brachial index by nearly 25% from the baseline level. The carried out treatment resulted in an increase in the number of patients with less severe stages of arterial insufficiency: initially stage IIa was diagnosed in 18 (28.2%) patients and at 3 months in 47 (73.4%) patients, with stage IIb being diagnosed in 46 (71.8 %) and 17 (26.6%) subjects, respectively. A conclusion was drawn that training walking considerably improved clinical manifestations of the disease. Taking into consideration availability of this therapeutic method, it should be recommended for patients suffering from intermittent claudication in long-term courses and in all cases where there are no contraindications thereto.

EA at 1 mA and 3 mA and Mox at 43 C and 46 C were applied to the Shangjuxu (ST37, bilateral) acupoints in model rats with visceral hypersensitivity. Responses of wide dynamic range neurons in dorsal horns of the spinal cord were observed through the extracellular recordings. Mast cells (MC) activity in the colons of rats were assessed, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor (5-HT3R) and 5-HT4R expressions in the colons were measured. Compared with normal control group, responses of wide dynamic range neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord were increased in the EA at 1 mA and 3 mA groups (1 mA: 0.84 +/- 0.74 vs 2.73 +/- 0.65, P &lt; 0.001; 3 mA: 1.91 +/- 1.48 vs 6.44 +/- 1.26, P &lt; 0.001) and Mox at 43 C and 46 C groups (43 C: 1.76 +/- 0.81 vs 4.14 +/- 1.83, P = 0.001; 46 C: 5.19 +/- 2.03 vs 7.91 +/- 2.27, P = 0.01). MC degranulation rates and the expression of 5-HT, 5-HT3R and 5-HT4R in the colon of Mox 46 C group were decreased compared with model group (MC degranulation rates: 0.47 +/- 0.56 vs 0.28 +/- 0.78, P &lt; 0.001; 5-HT: 1.42 +/- 0.65 vs 7.38 +/- 1.12, P &lt; 0.001; 5-HT3R: 6.62 +/- 0.77 vs 2.86 +/- 0.88, P &lt; 0.001; 5-HT4R: 4.62 +/- 0.65 vs 2.22 +/- 0.97, P &lt; 0.001). The analgesic effects of Mox at 46 C are greater than those of Mox at 43 C, EA 1 mA and EA 3 mA.MOXD1,Disease of anatomical entity,To assess the potential utility of a novel non-invasive muscle oxygen measurement to determine the presence of muscle hypoxia in patients with anaemia. Recent assessment of the risk/benefit ratio of blood transfusion has led to clinical strategies optimising transfusion decisions. These decisions are primarily based on haematocrit (Hct) but not oxygen delivery, the primary function of red blood cells (RBCs). We hypothesised that muscle oxygenation (MOx) would correlate with Hct in patients with anaemia and may be a physiologically relevant determinant of the transfusion threshold. MOx was non-invasively determined in children in the Cancer and Blood Disorders Center ambulatory clinic at Seattle Children's Hospital using a custom-designed optical probe and spectrometer. MOx was compared with contemporaneous Hct. In subjects receiving RBCs, MOx and Hct were also determined following transfusion. MOx ranged from 36*7 to 100%, and Hct ranged from 17*0 to 38*6% in 27 measurements from 16 patients. High MOx values were associated with high Hct. Mean MOx for patients with normal Hct for age (n = 5) was 95*9 +/- 2*9%. RBC transfusion increased mean Hct from 19*1 +/- 1*5% to 29*3 +/- 2*0 and mean MOx from 67*9 +/- 21*1% to 89*9 +/- 9*8%. Among six transfusion episodes (in five patients) with initial Hct &lt; 22, only three had a pre-transfusion MOx of &lt;70%. Patients with the lowest pre-transfusion MOx had the largest increase in MOx after transfusion. These preliminary data suggest that MOx may aid in making transfusion decisions when used in combination with Hct.MOXD1,Disease of anatomical entity,Aim. To compare whether there is different effect between electroacupuncture (EA) and moxibustion (Mox) on visceral hypersensitivity (their analgesic effects) in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (C-IBS). Methods. EA at 1 mA and 3 mA and Mox at 43C and 46C were applied to the Shangjuxu (ST37, bilateral) acupoint in rats with C-IBS and normal rats. An abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) score was used to assess visceral hypersensitivity. Toluidine blue staining was used to assess mast cell (MC) activity in colon of rats. Immunochemistry was used to measure 5-HT and 5-HT4 receptor expression in the colon. Results. AWR scores in all EA (1 mA and 3 mA) and Mox (43C and 46C) treatment groups after colorectal distention (CRD) stimulation pressure of 20, 40, 60, and 80 mmHg were significantly lower than those of the model (MC) group (P all &lt; 0.01). The MC counts and degranulation rates in the colon of all EA and Mox treatment groups and the MC group were significantly higher than those of the NC group (P all &lt; 0.01). MC degranulation rates in the colon of all EA and Mox treatment groups were lower than those of the MC group (P all &lt; 0.05). 5-HT expression in colon of all EA and Mox treatment groups was significantly lower than that of the MC group (P all &lt; 0.01), and 5-HT4R expression in colon of both EA groups was significantly higher than that of the MC group (P both &lt; 0.01). Conclusion. EA and Mox treatments may both ameliorate visceral hypersensitivity at different degree in rats with C-IBS, and EA treatment was better than Mox.MOXD1,Disease of anatomical entity,Current pharmacotherapies for alcohol used disorder (AUD) are few and relatively ineffective illustrating the need for the development of new, effective medications. Using a translational approach, our laboratory reported that ivermectin, an FDA-approved, human and animal anti-parasitic agent, can significantly reduce ethanol intake in male and female mice across different drinking paradigms. Extending this line of investigation, the current paper investigated the utility of moxidectin (MOX), an analogue of ivermectin, to reduce ethanol intake. Notably, MOX is widely held to have lower neurotoxicity potential and improved margin of safety compared to ivermectin. Using a 24-h-two-bottle choice paradigm, MOX significantly reduced ethanol intake in a dose dependent manner in both male and female C57BL/6J mice, respectively (1.25-7.5 mg/kg) and (1.25-10 mg/kg). Further, multi-day administration of MOX (2.5 mg/kg; intraperitoneal injection) for 5 consecutive days significantly reduced ethanol intake in both the 24-h-two-bottle choice and Drinking-in-the-Dark paradigms in female mice. No overt signs of behavioral toxicity were observed. Notably in both male and female mice, MOX significantly reduced ethanol intake starting approximately 4 h post-injection. Using a Xenopus oocyte expression system, we found that MOX significantly potentiated P2X4 receptor (P2X4R) function and antagonized the inhibitory effects of ethanol on ATP-gated currents in P2X4Rs. This latter finding represents the first report of MOX having activity on P2X4Rs. In addition, MOX potentiated GABAA receptors, but to a lesser degree as compared to ivermectin supporting the hypothesis that MOX would be advantageous (compared to ivermectin) with respect to reducing contraindications. Overall, the results illustrate the potential for development of MOX as a novel pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUD.MOXD1,Disease of anatomical entity,Odontogenic infections may lead to severe head and neck infections with potentially great health risk. Age, location of purulent affected sites and beta-lactam allergy are some mentionable factors regarding patients' in-hospital stay and course of disease. Are there new challenges regarding bacteria' antibiotic resistance for empiric treatment and what influences do they have on patients' clinical course? We analyzed in a 4-year retrospective study the medical records of 294 in-hospital patients with severe odontogenic infections. On a routine base bacteria were identified and susceptibility testing was performed. Length of stay in-hospital was evaluated regarding patients' age, beta-lactam allergy profile, affected sites and bacteria susceptibility to empiric antibiotics. Length of stay in-hospital was detected to be associated with affected space and penicillin allergy as well (p &lt; 0.05). Isolates presented large amounts of aerobic gram-positive bacteria (64.2%), followed by facultative anaerobic bacteria (gram+/15.8%, gram-/12.7%). Tested ampicillin in combination with sulbactam (or without) and cephalosporins displayed high susceptibility rates, revealing distinguished results regarding clindamycin (p &lt; 0.05). Co-trimoxazol and moxifloxacin showed high overall susceptibility rates (MOX: 94.7%, COTRIM: 92.6%). This study demonstrates ampicillin/sulbactam in addition to surgical intervention is a good standard in treatment of severe odontogenic neck infections. Cephalosporins seem to be a considerable option as well. If beta-lactam allergy is diagnosed co-trimoxazol and moxifloxacin represent relevant alternatives. Age, allergic profile and bacteria' resistance patterns for empiric antibiotics have an influence on patients in-hospital stay. Ampicillin/sulbactam proves itself to be good for empiric antibiosis in severe odontogenic infections. Furthermore cephalosporins could be considered as another option in treatment. However moxifloxacin and co-trimoxazol deserves further investigation as empiric antibiosis in odontogenic infections if beta-lactam allergy is diagnosed.MOXD1,Disease of anatomical entity,The role of macrophage iron in the physiopathology of atherosclerosis is an open question that needs to be clarified. In atherosclerotic lesions, recruited macrophages are submitted to cytokines and oxidized lipids which influence their phenotype. An important phenotypic population driven by oxidized phospholipids is the Mox macrophages which present unique biological properties but their iron phenotype is not well described. To investigate the effect of Mox polarization by oxidized LDL (oxLDL) on macrophage iron metabolism in the absence or presence of proinflammatory stimuli. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were treated with different sources of LDL and/or LPS/IFNGamma (M1 activator). Expression of ferroportin (Slc40a1, alias Fpn), heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1), H- and L-ferritin (Fth1 and Ftl1), hepcidin (Hamp), ceruloplasmin (Cp) and interleukine-6 (Il6) was followed by quantitative PCR. FPN and HMOX1 protein expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence and in-cell-Western blotting. Mox macrophages expressed increased Hmox1 and Fth1 levels with basal FPN protein levels despite the significant increase of Fpn mRNA. Upregulation of Hmox1 and Fpn mRNA was specific to LDL oxidative modification and mediated by NRF2. The downregulation of both Cp isoforms and the upregulation of Hamp expression observed in Mox macrophages suggest that FPN mediated iron export could be compromised. Simultaneous exposure to oxLDL and LPS/IFNGamma leads to a mixed Mox/M1 phenotype that is closer to M1. A microenvironment rich in oxLDL and proinflammatory cytokines could promote macrophage iron retention and lipid accumulation profiles, a specific cell phenotype that likely contributes to lesion development and plaque instability in atherosclerosis.LOX,Atrial fibrillation,Loop diuretics are used for fluid control in patients with heart failure. Furosemide and torasemide may exert differential effects on myocardial fibrosis. Here, we studied the effects of torasemide and furosemide on atrial fibrosis and remodeling during atrial fibrillation. In primary neonatal cardiac fibroblasts, torasemide (50myM, 24h) but not furosemide (50myM, 24h) reduced the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; 65+/-6%) and the pro-fibrotic miR-21 (44+/-23%), as well as the expression of lysyl oxidase (LOX; 57+/-8%), a regulator of collagen crosslinking. Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) expression and activity were not altered. Torasemide but not furosemide inhibited human aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) activity in transfected lung fibroblasts (V79MZ cells) by 75+/-1.8%. The selective CYP11B2 inhibitor SL242 mimicked the torasemide effects. Mice with cardiac overexpression of Rac1 GTPase (RacET), which develop atrial fibrosis and spontaneous AF with aging, were treated long-term (8months) with torasemide (10mg/kg/day), furosemide (40mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Treatment with torasemide but not furosemide prevented atrial fibrosis in RacET as well as the up-regulation of CTGF, LOX, and miR-2, whereas MR expression and activity remained unaffected. These effects correlated with a reduced prevalence of atrial fibrillation (33% RacET+Tora vs. 80% RacET). Torasemide but not furosemide inhibits CYP11B2 activity and reduces the expression of CTGF, LOX, and miR-21. These effects are associated with prevention of atrial fibrosis and a reduced prevalence of atrial fibrillation in mice.LOX,Atrial fibrillation,Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with increased volumes of epicardial fat and atrial adipocyte accumulation. Underlying mechanisms are not well understood. This study aims to identify rapid atrial pacing (RAP)/AF-dependent changes in atrial adipocyte/adipositas-related gene expression (AARE). Right atrial (RA) and adjacent epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) samples were obtained from 26 patients; 13 with AF, 13 in sinus rhythm (SR). Left atrial (LA) samples were obtained from 9 pigs (5 RAP, 4 sham-operated controls). AARE was analyzed using microarrays and RT-qPCR. The impact of diabetes/obesity on gene expression was additionally determined in RA samples (RAP ex vivo and controls) from 3 vs. 6 months old ZDF rats. RAP in vivo of pigs resulted in substantial changes of AARE, with 66 genes being up- and 53 down-regulated on the mRNA level. Differential expression during adipocyte differentiation was confirmed using 3T3-L1 cells. In patients with AF (compared to SR), a comparable change in RA mRNA levels concerned a fraction of genes only (RETN, IGF1, HK2, PYGM, LOX, and NR4A3). RA and EAT were affected by AF to a different extent. In patients, concomitant disease contributes to AARE changes. RAP, and to lesser extent AF, provoke significant changes in atrial AARE. In chronic AF, activation of this gene panel is very likely mediated by AF itself, AF risk factors and concomitant diseases. This may facilitate the development of an AF substrate by increasing atrial ectopic fat and fat infiltration of the atrial myocardium.LOX,Atrial fibrillation,We studied the role of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in the signaling that promotes atrial fibrosis. Left atrial myocardium of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) exhibited 4-fold increased hydroxyproline content compared with patients in sinus rhythm. Expression of MR was similar, as was 11Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11Beta-HSD2), which also increased. 11Beta-HSD2 converts cortisol to receptor-inactive metabolites allowing aldosterone occupancy of MR. 11Beta-HSD2 was up-regulated by arrhythmic pacing in cultured cardiomyocytes and in a mouse model of spontaneous AF (RacET). In cardiomyocytes, aldosterone induced connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the absence but not in the presence of cortisol. Hydroxyproline expression was increased in cardiac fibroblasts exposed to conditioned medium from aldosterone-treated cardiomyocytes but not from cardiomyocytes treated with both cortisol and aldosterone. Aldosterone increased connective tissue growth factor and hydroxyproline expression in cardiac fibroblasts, which were prevented by BR-4628, a dihydropyridine-derived selective MR antagonist, and by spironolactone. Aldosterone activated RhoA GTPase. Rho kinase inhibition by Y-27632 prevented CTGF and hydroxyproline, whereas the RhoA activator CN03 increased CTGF expression. Aldosterone and CTGF increased lysyl oxidase, and aldosterone enhanced miR-21 expression. MR antagonists reduced the aldosterone but not the CTGF effect. In conclusion, MR signaling promoted fibrotic remodeling. Increased expression of 11Beta-HSD2 during AF leads to up-regulation of collagen and pro-fibrotic mediators by aldosterone, specifically RhoA activity as well as CTGF, lysyl oxidase, and microRNA-21 expression. The MR antagonists BR-4628 and spironolactone prevent these alterations. MR inhibition may, therefore, represent a potential pharmacologic target for the prevention of fibrotic remodeling of the atrial myocardium.LOX,Atrial fibrillation,To compare the degree of mRNA expression for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tissue inhibitors (TIMPs), and lysyl oxidase in myocardial samples from dogs with cardiac and systemic diseases and from healthy control dogs. Myocardial samples from the atria, ventricles, and septum of 8 control dogs, 6 dogs with systemic diseases, 4 dogs with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and 5 dogs with other cardiac diseases. Degrees of mRNA expression for MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, and -13; TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4; and lysyl oxidase were measured via quantitative real-time PCR assay. Histologic examination of the hearts was performed to identify pathological changes. In myocardial samples from control dogs, only TIMP-3 and TIMP-4 mRNA expression was detected, with a significantly higher degree in male versus female dogs. In dogs with systemic and cardiac diseases, all investigated markers were expressed, with a significantly higher degree of mRNA expression than in control dogs. Furthermore, the degree of expression for MMP-2, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 was significantly higher in dogs with DCM than in dogs with systemic diseases and cardiac diseases other than DCM. Expression was generally greater in atrial than in ventricular tissue for MMP-2, MMP-13, and lysyl oxidase in samples from dogs with atrial fibrillation. Degrees of myocardial MMP, TIMP, and lysyl oxidase mRNA expression were higher in dogs with cardiac and systemic diseases than in healthy dogs, suggesting that expression of these markers is a nonspecific consequence of end-stage diseases. Selective differences in the expression of some markers may reflect specific pathogenic mechanisms and may play a role in disease progression, morbidity and mortality rates, and treatment response.LOX,Atrial fibrillation,Atrial fibrosis is important for the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF) but the underlying signal transduction is incompletely understood. We therefore studied the role of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and its downstream target Sprouty 1 (Spry1) during atrial fibrillation. Left atria (LA) from patients with AF showed a 2.5-fold increased expression of miR-21 compared to matched LA of patients in sinus rhythm. Increased miR-21 expression correlated positively with atrial collagen content and was associated with a reduced protein expression of Spry1 and increased expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), lysyl oxidase and Rac1-GTPase. Neonatal cardiac fibroblasts treated with angiotensin II (AngII) or CTGF showed an increased miR-21 and decreased Spry1 expression. Pretreatment with an inhibitor of Rac1 GTPase, NSC23766, reduced the AngII-induced upregulation of miR-21. A small molecule inhibitor of lysyl oxidase, BAPN, prevented the AngII as well as the CTGF-induced miR-21 expression. Transgenic mice with cardiac overexpression of Rac1, which develop spontaneous AF and atrial fibrosis with increasing age, showed upregulation of miR-21 expression associated with reduced Spry1 expression. miR-21 expression and signalling in vivo were prevented by long-term treatment of the mice with statins. Direct inhibition of miR-21 by antagomir-21 prevented fibrosis of the atrial myocardium post-myocardial infarction. Left atria of patients with atrial fibrillation are characterized by upregulation of miR-21 und reduced expression of Spry1. Activation of Rac1 by angiotensin II leads to a CTGF- and lysyl oxidase-mediated increase of miR-21 expression contributing to structural remodelling of the atrial myocardium.LOX,Atrial fibrillation,The aim of the study is to characterize the signal transduction leading to interstitial fibrosis in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial remodeling. Samples of the left atrial appendage (LA) from patients with AF showed higher collagen content (73 +/- 5 vs. 38 +/- 2 myg/mg protein) and 2.5-fold increased collagen crosslinking compared to patients with sinus rhythm (SR). Affymetrix-assays, RT-PCR and western Blot analysis revealed that LA of AF patients are characterized by increased lysyl oxidase (LOX) mRNA (218 +/- 42%) and protein (253 +/- 11%) expression. This was associated with increased expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibronectin and Rac1 activity compared to SR. In neonatal cardiac fibroblasts, the Rac1 specific small molecule inhibitor NSC23766 prevented angiotensin II (AngII) induced upregulation of LOX (214 +/- 16%) expression. Inhibition of CTGF by siRNA transfections completely inhibited AngII induced LOX expression. The LOX specific small molecule inhibitor BAPN prevented AngII and CTGF induced fibronectin expression. Left atria of transgenic mice with cardiac overexpression of Rac1 (RacET) that develop AF at high age exhibited upregulation of CTGF as well as LOX (187 +/- 7%) and fibronectin (627 +/- 146%) expression. Atria of RacET showed increased collagen content (28 +/- 2 myg/mg protein) and crosslinking (10 +/- 0.7) compared to wildtypes (20 +/- 0.4 myg/mg protein; 5 +/- 0.9). Left atrial myocardium of patients with atrial fibrillation is characterized by increased lysyl oxidase and fibronectin expression as well as collagen cross-linking. In cardiac fibroblasts, Rac1 GTPase mediates upregulation of fibronectin via LOX and CTGF. Inhibition of this signaling pathway may therefore represent a target for the prevention of fibrotic atrial remodeling.ZNF165,Azoospermia,A 38-year-old male with primary infertility was referred for cytogenetic investigation. Karyotype analysis revealed a 46,XY,t(6;21)(p21.1;pl3) translocation. The Ag-nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) banding technique demonstrated that the 21p NORs were retained in the derivative and actively transcribed. Family studies showed that three brothers, two sisters and their mother carried the t(6;21). All carrier males suffered from primary infertility with severe oligoasthenoteratospermia or azoospermia, whereas at least two of the three carrier women were fertile. The region of the translocation breakpoint was narrowed down cytogenetically and by fluorescence in situ hybridisation as 21p13 and 6p21.1. Southern blot analysis showed that the gene ZNF165, which maps to this region and which is specifically expressed in the testis, was not disrupted by the translocation. However, studies performed on testicular biopsy showed spermatocyte meiosis anomalies. We discuss the possible mechanisms by which the translocation might affect meiosis in spermatogenesis and lead to infertility.TARS,Pustulosis of palm and sole,We report the case of a 74-year-old man who suffered for four years from recurrent generalized pustular eruptions associated with acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (ACH). Initial therapy using topical corticosteroids, tars and PUVA failed to improve the acral lesions. The disease was also unresponsive to systemic therapy using corticosteroids, methotrexate, etretinate, acitretine and cyclosporin A. Serious side-effects were experienced with these drugs. A marked improvement of the generalized pustules was observed under treatment combining etretinate and methotrexate, without having any effect on the acropustulosis. During hospitalization, a topical tar therapy cleared the pustular rash. Again no effect was observed on the acral lesions. Disulone (DDS) therapy, initiated at a dose of 200 mg/day, completely cleared ACH after 4 weeks. The disease relapsed when the dose was reduced to 100 mg/day. Increasing the DDS to 150 mg/day was rapidly followed by a new clearance of the acral lesions. After a 3-month treatment, the patient has remained lesion free and no DDS-related side-effects have occurred. In conclusion, sulfones may be considered as an alternative therapeutic option in drug-resistant ACH.
