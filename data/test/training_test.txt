Our results demonstrated that hsa-miR-483-5p, hsa-miR-675, hsa-miR-139-3p, hsa-miR-598, hsa-miR-625 and hsa-miR-187 could serve as prognostic and predictive markers for survival of BDC patients and could potentially be provided as targets for future therapy. Targeting the centromeres of chromosomes 3, 7, 17 (CEP3, 7, 17) and the 9p21-locus (LSI9p21) for diagnosing bladder cancer (BC) is time- and cost-intensive and requires a manual investigation of the sample by a well-trained investigator thus overall limiting its use in clinical diagnostics and large-scaled epidemiological studies. Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) causing compressive cervical myelopathy or radiculopathy is rare. However, thoracic OLF rarely causes radiculopathy. We report a rare case of thoracic radiculopathy caused by OLF. Thoracic radiculopathy caused by OLF was suspected. Thoracic OLF rarely causes radiculopathy, but it should be considered as a differential diagnosis of thoracic radicular pain. OLF should be kept in mind if a patient presents with radiculopathy, particularly in the cervical region, for which surgical intervention is contemplated. Radiculopathy resulting from ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is extremely rare and concerns only intercostal neuralgias. We describe a 37-year-old Caucasian woman with a lumbar radiculopathy revealing an OLF. Pancreatitis was induced in C57Bl/6 wild-type (control), cathepsin B-knockout, and cathepsin L-knockout mice by partial pancreatic duct ligation with supramaximal caerulein injection, or by repetitive supramaximal caerulein injections alone. Trypsinogen became activated in macrophages cultured with purified trypsinogen or co-cultured with pancreatic acini and in pancreata of mice with pancreatitis; trypsinogen activation required macrophage endocytosis and expression and activity of cathepsin B, and was sensitive to pH. Activation of trypsinogen in macrophages resulted in translocation of NF-kB and production of inflammatory cytokines; mice without trypsinogen activation (cathepsin B-knockout mice) in macrophages developed less severe pancreatitis compared with control mice.
