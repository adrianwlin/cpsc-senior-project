miR-625	BDC	Our results demonstrated that hsa-miR-483-5p, hsa-miR-675, hsa-miR-139-3p, hsa-miR-598, hsa-miR-625 and hsa-miR-187 could serve as prognostic and predictive markers for survival of BDC patients and could potentially be provided as targets for future therapy.
CEP3	bladder cancer	Targeting the centromeres of chromosomes 3, 7, 17 (CEP3, 7, 17) and the 9p21-locus (LSI9p21) for diagnosing bladder cancer (BC) is time- and cost-intensive and requires a manual investigation of the sample by a well-trained investigator thus overall limiting its use in clinical diagnostics and large-scaled epidemiological studies.
OLF	radiculopathy	Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) causing compressive cervical myelopathy or radiculopathy is rare.
OLF	radiculopathy	However, thoracic OLF rarely causes radiculopathy.
OLF	radiculopathy	We report a rare case of thoracic radiculopathy caused by OLF.
OLF	radiculopathy	Thoracic radiculopathy caused by OLF was suspected.
OLF	radiculopathy	Thoracic OLF rarely causes radiculopathy, but it should be considered as a differential diagnosis of thoracic radicular pain.
OLF	radiculopathy	OLF should be kept in mind if a patient presents with radiculopathy, particularly in the cervical region, for which surgical intervention is contemplated.
OLF	Radiculopathy	Radiculopathy resulting from ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is extremely rare and concerns only intercostal neuralgias.
OLF	radiculopathy	We describe a 37-year-old Caucasian woman with a lumbar radiculopathy revealing an OLF.
cathepsin B	Pancreatitis	Pancreatitis was induced in C57Bl/6 wild-type (control), cathepsin B-knockout, and cathepsin L-knockout mice by partial pancreatic duct ligation with supramaximal caerulein injection, or by repetitive supramaximal caerulein injections alone.
cathepsin B	pancreatitis	Trypsinogen became activated in macrophages cultured with purified trypsinogen or co-cultured with pancreatic acini and in pancreata of mice with pancreatitis; trypsinogen activation required macrophage endocytosis and expression and activity of cathepsin B, and was sensitive to pH.
cathepsin B	pancreatitis	Activation of trypsinogen in macrophages resulted in translocation of NF-kB and production of inflammatory cytokines; mice without trypsinogen activation (cathepsin B-knockout mice) in macrophages developed less severe pancreatitis compared with control mice.
cathepsin B	pancreatitis	Transfer of macrophage from control mice to cathepsin B-knockout mice increased the severity of pancreatitis.
cathepsin B	acute pancreatitis	Experimental studies in acute pancreatitis (AP) suggest a strong association of acinar cell injury with cathepsin B-dependent intracellular activation of trypsin.
cathepsin B	pancreatitis	Pancreas, lung, and serum was harvested up to 48 h after pancreatitis induction and used for histopathology, amylase, lipase, cathepsin B, trypsin, and elastase activity measurements, myeloperoxidase (MPO) content and cytokine concentrations.
cathepsin B	pancreatitis	In taurocholate-pancreatitis AZD8309 reduced cathepsin B activity and MPO.
cathepsin B	pancreatitis	The lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin B (CTSB) is a known activator of trypsinogen, and its deletion reduces disease severity in experimental pancreatitis.
CTSB	pancreatitis	In summary, CTSB in pancreatitis undergoes activation in a secretory, vesicular, and acidic compartment where it activates trypsinogen.
C3F	renal failure	C3F was also significantly increased in 20 chronic renal failure (CRF) patients as compared to 196 controls; this would support the existence of functional differences between C3F and C3S alleles.
Bcl11b	craniosynostosis	Ectopic expression of Fgfr2c, a gene implicated in craniosynostosis in mice and humans, and that of Runx2 was detected within the affected sutures of Bcl11b(-/-) mice.
Bcl11b	craniosynostosis	These data suggest that ectopic expression of Fgfr2c in the sutural mesenchyme, without concomitant changes in the expression of FGF ligands, appears to induce the RUNX2-dependent osteogenic program and craniosynostosis in Bcl11b(-/-) mice.
HLA-B7	pernicious anemia	(2) An analysis of all published HLA data for patients of European origin indicated a weak association of pernicious anemia with HLA-B7.
miR-221	prostate cancer	Specifically, studies have demonstrated miR-221/-222 function as oncogenes, and promote PCa cell proliferation and the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
miR-221	bladder cancer	SOCS3 was found significantly declined, while microRNA-221 (miR-221) obviously up-regulated in bladder cancer tissue.
miR-221	bladder cancer	This study investigated the role of miR-221 in regulating SOCS3/JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway and bladder cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.
miR-221	Bladder cancer	Bladder cancer tumor tissue and para-carcinoma tissue were collected from patients to test miR-221 and SOCS3 expressions.
MiR-221	bladder cancer	MiR-221 significantly increased, while SOCS3 obviously reduced in bladder cancer tissue compared with para-carcinoma tissue.
MiR-221	bladder cancer	MiR-221 elevated, while SOCS3 reduced in bladder cancer tissue.
miR-221	prostate cancer	As miR-221 targets several regulators of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and a link between this pathway and CD44 has been previously shown in prostate cancer, we considered miR-221 regulation of CD44 may be through this pathway.
miR-221	prostate cancer	The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene status, tumor tissue prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), miR-23b, miR-26a and miR-221 expression levels in combination with preoperative serum PSA level to the risk of PCa recurrence after radical prostatectomy.
OASL	OAS	Only 5 genes were significantly up-regulated in MS patients vs control subjects; namely TNF-AIP6, IL-1RA, OASL, CLC and DOCK4 (p &lt; 0.05).
OASL	OAS	Analysis of the effector molecules of the up-regulated genes revealed that 83 MS patients had positive serum level of OASL, 87 MS patients had positive serum levels of IL-1RA, and none of the 88 MS patients showed detectable serum levels of TNF-AIP6, CLC or DOCK4.
OASL	disease	OASL and IL-1RA genes were strongly expressed in MS patients and that their effector molecules may be considered as biomarkers associated with the inflammatory process of the disease and possibly treatment response.
OASL	OAS	However, IRF1, IFNK and viral restriction factors (IFIT1, 2, 3, 5, OASL, CD74, RTP4) were up-regulated.
OASL	OAS	The signature's genes are: Interferon Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15), Interleukin 16 (IL16), 2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like (OASL), and Adhesion G Protein Coupled Receptor E5 (ADGRE5).
OASL	OAS	Previous work has identified that following viral infection, type I IFN signaling induces the production of the 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family, which include OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and OAS-like (OASL) protein.
OASL	OAS	OASL was identified to be strongly induced following viral infection through engaging the RNA sensor RIG-I and increasing signaling through this pathway to enhance the anti-viral type I IFN response.
OASL	OAS	Surprisingly, infection with viral dsDNA revealed an IFN inhibitory role and therefore pro-viral function of OASL through the inhibition of the cGAS cytosolic DNA sensing mechanism.
OASL	OAS	Intracellular bacteria are able to activate the cytosolic DNA sensing pathway, however the role of OASL during bacterial infection is largely unknown.
OASL	OAS	Vacuolar pathogenic microbes such as mycobacteria induce OASL early post infection, where it functions in a prosurvival fashion by inhibiting autophagic mechanisms and antimicrobial peptide expression.
OASL	OAS	This suggests an underestimated role of OASL in the innate immune response to infection with a variety of pathogens and points to OASL-associated modulation of the type I IFN response.
OASL	OAS	OASL may therefore play a critical role in defining the outcome of infection.
OASL	OAS	We earlier nominated 16 genes (IRF7, IFIT1, IFIT5, OASL, CLC, GBP-1, PSMB9, HERC5, CCR1, CD36, MS4A4A, BIRC4BP, PLSCR1, DEFA1/DEFA3, DEFA4, and COL9A2) as predictors of response to remission induction therapy against MPA.
OASL	OAS	The 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) is an interferon (IFN)-induced protein that plays an important role in the antiviral action of IFN, with OAS3 being one of the four OAS classes (OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, OASL).
OASL	OAS	In a pooled analysis of 105 candidate genes and two genome-wide association studies, we observed associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms from nine genes (EIF2AK2, IFNAR2, ITPA, MBL2, MX1, OASL, SPP1, TGFB1, TNK2) with response to interferon-based therapy.
OASL	OAS	Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the OAS1 (rs1131476), OAS2 (rs1293747), OAS3 (rs2072136), OASL (rs10849829) and IL28B (rs12979860, rs12980275 and rs8099917) genes were studied to examine their associations with responses to IFN treatment in paediatric patients.
OASL	OAS	The association analysis for CR showed that the TT genotype of IL28B rs12979860 was present only in the no-CR group (P = 0.033) and the AA genotype of OASL rs10849829 was significantly more frequent in the no-CR group (P = 0.044, OR = 0.26, 95%CI: 0.07-0.88).
CARS	mixed bipolar disorder	The aim of the present study was to evaluate agreement between three pairs formed by one of three mania scales (Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS], Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Scale [BRMS], or the Clinician-Administered Rating Scale for Mania [CARS-M]) and a single depression scale (21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [21-HAM-D]) for evaluation of response to mood stabilizers in patients with mixed bipolar disorder.
CARS	mixed bipolar disorder	The present study suggests that any one of the three tested mania rating scales (YMRS, BRMS, and CARS-M) can be combined with the 21-HAM-D to assess treatment response in patients with mixed bipolar disorder.
CARs	dementia	Older adults and patients with dementia often have disrupted circadian activity rhythms (CARs).
miR-25	breast cancer	Clinically, decreased levels of cGAS are associated with poor prognosis for patients with breast cancer harbouring high levels of miR-25/93.
hsa-miR-25-3p	breast cancer	In our analysis, we found that increased expression of 12 mature miRNAs-hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-361-5p, hsa-miR-103a-3p, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-374b-5p, hsa-miR-140-3p, hsa-miR-25-3p, hsa-miR-651-5p, hsa-miR-200c-3p, hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-miR-30c-5p, and hsa-let-7i-5p -each predicted improved breast cancer survival.
miR-25	breast cancer	Here, we report a novel function of isoliquiritigenin (ISL) as a natural inhibitor of autophagy-related miR-25 in killing drug-resistant breast cancer cells.
miR-25	breast cancer	Overall, our results not only indicate that ISL acts as a natural autophagy inducer to increase breast cancer chemosensitivity, but also reveal that miR-25 functions as a novel regulator of autophagy by targeting ULK1.
TOM34	cancer	Expression of a panel of seven microRNAs (hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-16, hsa-miR-17, hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-221, hsa-miR-326, and hsa-miR-375) and seven target genes ( E2F3, PI3KCA, TOM34, WNT5A, PDCD4, DFFA, and EGFR) in 43 glioblastoma multiforme specimens were profiled compared to non-cancer tissues via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

TOMM34	colorectal cancer	Quantification of TOMM34 and RNF43 gene expression in several-year-old paraffin-embedded colorectal cancer specimens was possible by qPCR using the Universal ProbeLibrary.
TOMM34	Wilms' tumor	The mRNA levels of seven TAAs, Wilms' tumor gene (WT1), kinetochore associated-2 (KNTC2), cell division cycle associated-1 (CDCA1), M phase phosphoprotein-1 (MPHOSPH1), DEP domain-containing 1 (DEPDC1), 34-kDa translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM34) and ring finger protein-43 (RNF43), were analyzed using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and their relationships with clinicopathological factors and the cell cycle were analyzed.
TOMM34	cancer	These antigenic peptides were derived from 5 proteins identified as cancer-testis antigens(ring finger protein 43 [RNF43], translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 34[TOMM34], maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase[MELK], forkhead box M1[FOXM1], and holliday junction recognition protein[HJURP])and 2 vascular endothelial growth factor receptors(VEGFR1 and VEGFR2).
TOMM34	colorectal cancer	To evaluate the safety of combination vaccine treatment of multiple peptides, phase I clinical trial was conducted for patients with advanced colorectal cancer using five novel HLA-A*2402-restricted peptides, three peptides derived from oncoantigens, ring finger protein 43 (RNF43), 34 kDa-translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOMM34), and insulin-like growth factor-II mRNA binding protein 3 (KOC1), and the remaining two from angiogenesis factors, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2.
TOMM34	cancer	These antigenic peptides were derived from 2 different cancer-testis antigens, ring finger protein 43 (RNF43) and translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 34( TOMM34).
TOMM34	colorectal cancer	We conducted a clinical trial of colorectal cancer-specific peptide( RNF43, TOMM34) vaccines with uracil/tegafur( UFT)+Leucovorin( LV) for the treatment of advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer.
TOMM34	colorectal cancer	We started a clinical trial of vaccines against multiple peptides (RNF43, TOMM34, forkhead box protein M1 [FOXM1], maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase [MELK], holliday junction recognition protein[HJURP], vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1[VEGFR1], and VEGFR2) for the treatment of advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer.
TOMM34	colorectal cancer	Recently, analysis of tumor antigens using micro-arrays has revealed upregulation             of cancer-testis antigens RNF43 and TOMM34 and vascular endothelial growth factor             receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 in colorectal cancer.
WNT11	prostate cancer	Our aim was to analyze the dynamic modulation, determined by ADT, of the expression of selected genes involved in the pathogenesis and progression of prostate cancer (TMPRSS2:ERG, WNT11, SPINK1, CHGA, AR, and SPDEF) using real-time polymerase chain reaction in a series of 59 surgical samples of prostate carcinomas, including 37 cases preoperatively treated with ADT and 22 untreated cases, and in 43 corresponding biopsies.
Wnt-11	cervical cancer	However, Wnt-11 expression in cervical cancer has not been well investigated.
Wnt-11	cervical cancer	Wnt-11 and HR-HPV E6 expression increased in a manner that corresponded with the progression of cervical cancer and was significantly correlated with the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics cancer stage, lymph node metastasis, tumor size, and HPV infection.
Wnt-11	cervical cancer	Wnt-11 protein expression was positively associated with HR-HPV E6 protein expression in all 78 cervical cancer samples (P &lt; 0.001).
Wnt-11	cervical cancer	Furthermore, Wnt-11 was positively associated with P-JNK1 expression and promoted cervical cancer cell proliferation and invasion.
Wnt-11	cervical cancer	These observations suggest that the increased Wnt-11 expression observed in cervical cancer cells may lead to the phosphorylation and activation of JNK-1 and significantly promote tumor cell proliferation and cell migration/invasion through activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway.
Wnt-11	cervical cancer	Consequently, Wnt-11 may serve as a novel target for cervical cancer therapy.
interferon gamma	multiple myeloma	In this study, we aimed to explore the association among gene variants of five cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Alfa), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-Beta1), interferon gamma (IFN-Gamma), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10), and clinical parameters and prognosis in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) treated with novel therapeutic drugs in Turkish population for the first time except TNF-Alfa.
HBA1	cardiomyopathy	Using absolute value of log2 fold-change &gt; 2 or extremely small P value (10-20) as a criterion, we identified nine significant genes (HBA1, HBB, HIST1H2AC, GSTT1, MYL7, NPPA, NPPB, PDK4, PLA2G2A) in LVH, also found in published data set for ischemic and dilated cardiomyopathy in heart failure.
kappa-casein	atopic dermatitis	Tolerized cow's milk protein (CMP)-sensitive atopic dermatitis had, in particular, decreased kappa-casein-specific IgG(1) levels, compared with clinically reactive patients.
kappa-casein	atopic dermatitis	Tolerised patients, particularly those with atopic dermatitis, had decreased responses to kappa-casein which were restored after Treg depletion.
kappa-casein	atopic dermatitis	A markedly decreased proliferative response to kappa-casein in tolerised IgE-mediated CMA patients with atopic dermatitis, which was abrogated by Treg depletion, suggested a role for kappa-casein in tolerance induction.
kappa-casein	atopic dermatitis	In order to investigate the role of food antigen-specific T cells circulating in the blood of patients with food allergy, we compared T cell response to three casein components (alpha s-, beta- and, kappa-casein) with specificities of IgG and IgE binding to the casein components in four milk-allergic patients (P1-4) with atopic dermatitis.
PKM2	glucose intolerance	Studies have identified that PKM2 is related to the development of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in rodents and humans.
PKM2	hyperglycemia	Mechanistically, we showed that hyperglycemia and diabetes decreased PKM2 tetramer formation and activity by sulfenylation in mouse glomeruli and cultured podocytes.
Pkm	diabetes	Podocyte-specific Pkm2-knockout (KO) mice with diabetes developed worse albuminuria and glomerular pathology.
PKM2	hyperglycemia	Conversely, we found that pharmacological activation of PKM2 by a small-molecule PKM2 activator, TEPP-46, reversed hyperglycemia-induced elevation in toxic glucose metabolites and mitochondrial dysfunction, partially by increasing glycolytic flux and PGC-1Alfa mRNA in cultured podocytes.
miR-155	Hodgkin lymphoma	To identify the miR-155 targets relevant for B-cell lymphoma, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation of Argonaute 2 in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cells upon miR-155 inhibition and in BL cells upon ectopic expression of miR-155.
CDK6	bladder cancer	Further research suggested that METTL13 negatively regulates cell proliferation in bladder cancer and reinstates G1/S checkpoint via the coordinated downregulation of CDK6, CDK4 and CCND1, decreased phosphorylation of Rb and subsequent delayed cell cycle progression.
CDK6	bladder cancer	miR-29c could inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells via regulating CDK6.
doublecortin	subependymal giant cell astrocytoma	p34cdc2, collapsin response mediator protein 4 (CRMP4), doublecortin (DCX), HuD, and NeuN expression was assessed in tuber (n = 16) and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA; n = 6) specimens in tuberous sclerosis complex to define the developmental phenotype and lineage of giant cells (CGs) in these lesions.
H1A	prostate cancer	First, logistic regression analysis in two human prostate gene expression datasets revealed that expression levels of five genes (CXCL14, ITGAX, LPCAT2, RNASEH2A, and ZNF322) were positively correlated with aggressive prostate cancer and two genes (CCL19 and HIST1H1A) were protective for aggressive prostate cancer.
H1A	rhinitis	Second generation H1 antihistamines (H1A) are currently recommended as first choice medications for allergic rhinitis and rhinoconjunctivitis.
H1A	rhinitis	Consecutive patients suffering from allergic rhinitis or rhinoconjunctivitis were included and followed prospectively for 30 days from the prescription of a second generation H1A in monotherapy.
H1a	influenza	Antibody 3.1 potently neutralizes influenza viruses from the H1a clade (i.e., H1, H2, H5, H6) but has little neutralizing activity against the H1b clade.
OTX2	retinitis pigmentosa	We have overexpressed OTX2 in retinal pigmented epithelial cells before their transplantation in the eye of a model of retinitis pigmentosa carrying a mutation in Mertk, a gene specifically expressed by retinal pigmented epithelial cells.
OTX2	age-related macular degeneration	Transplantation of OTX2-genetically modified cells may be medically effective for other retinal diseases involving the retinal pigmented epithelium as age-related macular degeneration.
OTX2	retinal disease	Therapeutic restoration of OTX2 expression might help revive RPE and visual function in retinal diseases such as AMD.
Otx2	retinal disease	The retinal disease resembles conditional mice models that show slow photoreceptor degeneration secondary to loss of Otx2 function in the adult RPE.
amelogenin	RP59	When the beads were coated with amelogenin gene splice products (A+4 or A-4), the expression of osteo-chondrogenic markers (RP59, Sox9, or BSP) was also observed.
SVCT2	osteoporosis	This study has provided evidence that the regulation of the SVCT2 transporter plays an important role not only in T1D osteoporosis but also in other oxidative stress-related musculoskeletal complications.

OMD	generalized dystonia	Most frequent disease presentation in our patients was characterized with early and prominent oromandibular dystonia (OMD), followed by severe generalized dystonia and early loss of mobility within the first five years of prolonged disease duration (18.7 +/- 10.0 years).
OMD	generalized dystonia	Eight out of 9 patients reached 7 significant clinical milestones (OMD, generalized dystonia, dysarthria, dysphagia, postural instability, gait difficulties, ADL dependency) in the first 4.6 years of disease course.
smoothelin	intestinal pseudo-obstruction	A smoothelin-deficient mouse model may help to establish the role of smoothelin-A in intestinal contraction and provide a model for myogenic chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.
smoothelin	intestinal pseudo-obstruction	The pathology of mice lacking smoothelin-A is reminiscent of that seen in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction.
tyrosinemia type 1	liver disease	Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is characterized by severe progressive liver disease and renal tubular dysfunction.
FAH	liver disease	If left untreated this deficiency of functional FAH leads to a buildup of toxic metabolites that can cause liver disease, kidney dysfunction and high mortality.
fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase	cirrhosis	In this study, we investigated whether fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase deficient (FAH-/-) pigs, a novel large-animal model of HT1, develop fibrosis and cirrhosis characteristic of the human disease.
FAH	liver disease	Under conditions of low-dose NTBC, FAH-/- pigs developed liver fibrosis and portal hypertension, and thus may serve as a large-animal model of chronic liver disease.
Fah	cirrhosis	Fah-deficient mice and pigs are phenotypically analogous to human HT1, but do not recapitulate all the chronic features of the human disorder, especially liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Fah	cirrhosis	More importantly, the Fah(-/-) rats developed remarkable liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, which have not been observed in Fah mutant mice or pigs.
Fah	cirrhosis	Moreover, the highly efficient repopulation of hepatocytes in Fah(-/-) livers prevented the progression of liver fibrosis to cirrhosis and in turn restored liver architecture.
Fah	liver cirrhosis	These results indicate that Fah(-/-) rats may be used as an animal model of HT1 with liver cirrhosis.
DPM2	glaucoma	Recent GWAS completed for three types of common adult-onset glaucoma have identified novel loci for POAG (primary-open-angle glaucoma) (ABCA1, AFAP1, GMDS, PMM2, TGFBR3, FNDC3B, ARHGEF12, GAS7, FOXC1, ATXN2, TXNRD2); PACG (primary angle-closure glaucoma (EPDR1, CHAT, GLIS3, FERMT2, DPM2-FAM102); and exfoliation syndrome (XFS) glaucoma (CACNA1A).

CD49d	systemic sclerosis	To evaluate serum levels of fractalkine (FKN), a mediator of leukocyte transmigration, C-reactive protein (CRP) and expression of integrins CD11a and CD49d on peripheral blood lymphocytes in systemic sclerosis (SSc) and to investigate whether they are modulated by intravenous prostaglandin E1 (PGE1).
CD49d	systemic sclerosis	Prostaglandin E1 down-regulates serum fractalkine level, as well as CD11a and CD49d expression on peripheral blood lymphocytes, which suggests additional mechanisms in which this vasodilatatory agent exerts its efficacy in systemic sclerosis.
RSK	cancer	MR-1S directly phosphorylates and activates the MEK-ERK-RSK pathway to accelerate cancer growth and facilitates metastasis by activating the MLC2-FAK-AKT pathway.
P90RSK	cancer	After overexpressing TMEM17, levels of p-ERK and its downstream molecules, p-P90RSK and Snail, were down-regulated, while levels of Occludin and Zo-1 were up-regulated, which result in the inhibition of invasion and migration ability of lung cancer cells.
sPLA2	obesity	Herein, to understand the underlying relationship between obesity and brain tumors, we investigated the effect of leptin, alone or in combination with sPLA2-IIA on astrocytoma cell functions.
PLA2g2a	obesity	PLA2g2a was elevated with hypothyroidism and high fat diets which may contribute to the low grade inflammation associated with hypothyroidism and diet induced obesity.
sPLA2	obesity	There were significant correlations between age, visceral obesity, MPO, sPLA2, and SAA (r = 0.43; p = 0.00; r = 0.30; p = 0.00; r = 0.28; p = 0.00 and r = 0.53; p = 0.00).
pla2g2a	obesity	We suggest that pla2g2a may have a causal relationship with chronic adiposity and metabolic syndrome and that its inhibition in vivo may be a valuable new approach to treat obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic dysfunction in humans.
ornithine decarboxylase	African trypanosomiasis	Trypanosoma brucei, protozoan parasites that cause human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), depend on ornithine uptake and metabolism by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) for survival.
ODC	leishmaniasis	Furthermore, the molecular dynamics simulation work reveals that ZINC67909154 could be a potent inhibitor and this compound can be used to combat VL disease Conclusion: This study concludes that ZINC67909154 has the great potential to inhibit L. donovani ODC and would add to the drug discovery process against visceral leishmaniasis.
ornithine decarboxylase	leishmaniasis	arginase (ARG), ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), spermidine synthase (SpdS), trypanothione synthetase (TryS or TSA), trypanothione reductase (TryR or TR), tryparedoxin peroxidase (TXNPx), deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) are promising targets for the development of new drugs against leishmaniasis.
ornithine decarboxylase	cutaneous leishmaniasis	The plasma levels of arginase I, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), transforming growth factor Beta (TGF-Beta), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were higher in patients with DCL, compared with patients with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (LCL) or with controls from an area of endemicity.
ODC	DCL	Immunohistochemistry confirmed that arginase I, ODC, and cyclooxygenase2 expression was higher in lesion biopsy specimens from patients with DCL than in those from patients with LCL.
ODC	DCL	Our data implicate arginase I, ODC, PGE2, and TGF-Beta in the failure to mount an efficient immune response and suggest perspectives in the development of new strategies for therapeutic intervention for patients with DCL.
ornithine decarboxylase	malaria	The active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal 5-phosphate, is, besides its antioxidative properties, a cofactor for a variety of essential enzymes present in the malaria parasite which includes the ornithine decarboxylase (ODC, synthesis of polyamines), the aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT, involved in the protein biosynthesis), and the serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT, a key enzyme within the folate metabolism).
ornithine decarboxylase	African sleeping sickness	Alfa-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a potent drug used for the treatment of African sleeping sickness is an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the first rate limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis.

COBL	diabetes	Autoantibodies to insulin (IAA), GAD (GADA), insulinoma-associated antigen-2 (IA-2A) and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A) were measured in follow-up sera, and genotyping for type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes (HLA-DR/HLA-DQ, INS variable number of tandem repeats [VNTR] and single nucleotide polymorphisms at PTPN22, PTPN2, ERBB3, IL2, SH2B3, CTLA4, IFIH1, KIAA0350 [also known as CLEC16A], CD25, IL18RAP, IL10, COBL) was performed on the DNA samples of children born to a parent with type 1 diabetes and prospectively followed from birth for up to 22 years.
COBL	diabetes	Children of parents with type 1 diabetes and prospectively followed from birth for the development of islet autoantibodies and diabetes were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms at 12 type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes (ERBB3, PTPN2, IFIH1, PTPN22, KIAA0350, CD25, CTLA4, SH2B3, IL2, IL18RAP, IL10 and COBL).
COBL	diabetes	The greatest diabetes discrimination was obtained by the sum of risk alleles for eight genes (IFIH1, CTLA4, PTPN22, IL18RAP, SH2B3, KIAA0350, COBL and ERBB3) in the HLA-risk children.
IL-3	allergic asthma	However, all of the eosinophil-activating cytokines, such as IL-5, IL-3, and GM-CSF, are typically present in atopic diseases, including allergic asthma.
IL-3	allergic asthma	In a murine model of allergic asthma, we found that Tyk-2((-/-)) asthmatic mice have induced peribronchial collagen deposition, mucosal type mast cells in the lung, IRF4 and hyperproliferative lung Th2 CD4(+) effector T cells over-expressing IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13.
Keap1	hypoglycemia	Heterologous or homologous Nrf2 deletion (Nrf2+/- or Nrf2-/-) rescued the pancreatic phenotypes, weight loss and hypoglycemia in KC::Keap1 mice, suggesting that Nrf2 is a major downstream target of Keap1.

ACSVL3	glioblastoma multiforme	This study investigates the role of ACSVL3 in the maintenance of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) stem cell self-renewal and the capacity of GBM stem cells to initiate tumor xenograft formation.
ACSVL3	GBM	We examined ACSVL3 expression during differentiation of several GBM stem cell enriched neurosphere cultures.
ACSVL3	GBM	ACSVL3 expression levels were substantially increased in GBM stem cell enriched neurosphere cultures and decreased after differentiation of the neurospheres.
ACSVL3	GBM	Furthermore, ACSVL3 knockdown reduced anchorage-independent neurosphere cell growth, neurosphere-forming capacity as well as self-renewal of these GBM stem cell enriched neurosphere cultures.
ACSVL3	GBM	A link between ACSVL3 and cancer stem cell phenotype was further established by the findings that ACSVL3 expression was regulated by receptor tyrosine kinase pathways that support GBM stem cell self-renewal and tumor initiation, including EGFR and HGF/c-Met pathways.
ACSVL3	GBM	Our findings indicate that the lipid metabolism enzyme ACSVL3 is involved in GBM stem cell maintenance and the tumor-initiating capacity of GBM stem cell enriched-neurospheres in animals.
TLR9	myositis	A significant association was detected between TLR9 genotypes and some of the disease manifestations as myositis (p = 0.032), psychosis (p = 0.014), photosensitivity (p = 0.002), and pleurisy (p = &lt;0.001).
HMGB2	acute monocytic leukemia	In addition, rLj-HMGB2 could induce the generation of proinflammatory mediators in the activated human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP1), which suggested that Lj-HMGB2 may participate in the immune response of the lampreys.

Rab-12	LCA	Proteins labeled with LCA were Rab-3, Rab-12, Rab-16, and M-Ras.
ANT2	oncocytoma	Moreover, the ANT2 precursors were observed to change in oncocytomas.
ANT2	oncocytoma	In particular, a high transcript level for the adenine nucleotide translocator isoform 2(ANT2) gene, which is usually not expressed in differentiated cells, was observed in oncocytoma and malignant urothelial renal tumor.
CYP	breast cancer	This study aimed to assess inflammatory, cardiac, renal and hematological markers in 56 breast cancer patients (BCP) before, during and after termination of chemotherapy with CYP and DOX.
CYP	breast cancer	Based on the results, we conclude that breast cancer and co-treatment of CYP and DOX interfere with various biological markers, thereby, showing the physiological imbalance.
CYP	breast cancer	Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) production via cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases closely correlates with the progression of breast cancer.
CYP	breast cancer	Here, we found that CYP3A4 expression and its epoxy-product, 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-EET) was enhanced in tamoxifen (TAM)-resistant MCF-7 (TAMR-MCF-7) breast cancer cells compared to control MCF-7 cells.
CYP	breast cancer	Our findings suggest that the CYP3A4-mediated EET pathway represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.
CYP	breast cancer	CYP3A4 was unexpectedly associated with breast cancer mitochondria and synthesized arachidonic acid (AA)-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which promoted the electron transport chain/respiration and inhibited AMPKAlfa.
CYP	mammary tumor	CYP3A4 knockdown activated AMPKAlfa, promoted autophagy, and prevented mammary tumor formation.

CD38	obesity	It has been recently reported that CD38 was highly expressed in adipose tissues from obese people and CD38-deficient mice were resistant to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity.
CD38	obesity	In this study, to explore the roles of CD38 in adipogenesis and lipogenesis in vivo and in vitro, obesity models were generated with male CD38-/- and WT mice fed with HFD.
CD38	obesity	The results showed that CD38-/- male mice were significantly resistant to HFD-induced obesity.
CD38	obesity	These results suggest that CD38 deficiency impairs adipogenesis and lipogenesis through activating Sirt1/PPARGamma-FASN signalling pathway during the development of obesity.
CD38	obesity	We also found that obesity development was associated with an increase in the number of CD38+ adipose progenitors, this effect being more pronounced in intra-abdominal than in subcutaneous fat, suggesting a higher rate of adipocyte commitment in visceral depots.
CD38	diabetes	In this study, we show that CD45RO+CD38+ Beta cell Ag-specific CD4+ T cells were present at higher frequencies in type 1 diabetes subjects compared with those in healthy subjects.
CD38	glucose intolerance	Regulation of the SIRT/NAD system was associated with early (SIRT4, SIRT7, NAPRT1 and NMNAT2) and late phases (NMNAT3, NMRK2, ABCA1 and CD38) of glucose intolerance.
CD38	diabetes	A total of eleven of genes were differently expressed in celiac patients compared with disease controls of which CD36, CD38, FOXP1, SELL, PPARA, PPARG, AGT previously associated with type 2 diabetes and AKAP6, NTNG1 with anorexia nervosa remained significant after correction for multiple testing.
Hsc70-interacting protein	SBMA	PF significantly increased the expression of nuclear factor-YA (NF-YA), which strongly upregulated the molecules involved in the proteolytic machinery [molecular chaperones, carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein and transcription factor EB], which thus mitigated the behavioral and pathological impairments in an SBMA mouse model through the upregulation of pathogenic androgen receptor protein clearance in motor neurons and muscles.
IDH	hypertension	One hundred and seven patients (49.3%) had no significant change in BP; 30.9% had intradialytic hypertension (IDHT) while 19.8% had intradialytic hypotension (IDH).
IDH	hypertension	This week's articles describe ways to treat arthritis caused by chikungunya virus, IDH-mutant cancers, and hypertension.
IDH	HTN	On univariate analysis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension (HTN), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), smoking, hepatitis C, inadequate dialysis, intradialytic hypotension (IDH), interdialytic weight gain, low serum creatinine &lt;4 mg/dL, and anemia (Hb &lt;10 g/dL) were found to be statistically significantly different between frail and nonfrail groups On multivariate regression analysis, only HTN, PVD, CVA, anemia, smoking, and IDH were found to be significant.
IDH	HTN	Factors predicting frailty include HTN, smoking, LVD, PVD, CVA, smoking, anemia, and IDH.
IDH	hypertension	Intradialytic hypertension (IDH) increases morbidity and mortality.
IDH	HTN	Intradialytic hypertension (ID-HTN) is an increasingly recognized phenomenon and although less common than IDH, portends poor cardiovascular prognosis as well as reflects higher hypertension burden in the dialysis population.
IDH	hypertension	Dry weight, hypertension, and phosphorus levels are modifiable risk factors to possibly reduce the rate of IDH episodes.
IDP	hypertension	We believe that all hypertension guidelines should follow the National Institute for Health and Excellence (NICE) and make IDP and CTD first choice 'thiazide-like diuretics.'
SOX6	pilocytic astrocytoma	Immunohistochemical analysis with the anti-SOX6 antibody showed that all the glioma tissues analyzed (14 glioblastomas, 14 anaplastic astrocytomas, 3 anaplastic oligoastrocytomas, 5 diffuse astrocytomas, 1 oligodendroglioma, and 1 pilocytic astrocytoma) expressed SOX6 in tumor cells, but only a few SOX6-positive cells were detected in nonneoplastic tissues from the cerebral cortex.
Il1alpha	RP3	To address these issues, we analyzed the production of proinflammatory mediators in mouse thyroid organs and demonstrate consistency with in vitro studies performed previously that Il1alpha, Il1beta, Il6, and Tnfalpha and the enzyme Cox2 are produced by RP3-transgenic thyroid tissue, but absent from nontransgenic thyroids.
endostatin	vascular disease	With a few exceptions, higher circulating levels of endostatin seem to reflect vascular and myocardial damage, and a worsened prognosis for cardiovascular events or mortality in individuals with hypertension, diabetes, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, as well as in the general population.

spasm	hydrocephalus	Surgical treatment after radiosurgery or radiotherapy may be necessary for tumors that continue to grow, or for patients who develop brainstem compressive symptoms, disabling hemifacial spasm, or hydrocephalus.
DEGs	cervical cancer	Among these, 236 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were statistically significant, including many DEGs that were novel in cervical cancer, including gastrulation brain homeobox 2,5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1D and endothelin 3.
DEGs	cervical cancer	A total of 5 overlapping genes [dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4); endothelin 3 (EDN3); fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14); tachykinin, precursor 1 (TAC1); and wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 16 (WNT16)] between the 561 overlapping differentially methylated genes and the 242 DEGs were identified, which were downregulated and hypermethylated simultaneously in cervical cancer samples.
DEGs	cervical cancer	Employing functions of several bioinformatics tools, we selected 143 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with the cervical cancer.

PHD finger protein 19	glioma	Survival analysis then revealed a five-PcG gene signature one protective gene (enhancer of zeste homolog 1) and four risky genes (EZH2, PHD finger protein 19, DNMT3A and DNMT3B), which may identify patients with high risk of poor prognosis of glioma.
PCL3	cancer	In this study, we exploited this platform to evaluate the behavior of two biodegradable formulations, poly-Epsilon-caprolactone (PCL3) and poly lactic-acid (PLA8), respectively, in cellular and animal models of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).
PHF19	astrocytoma	Interestingly, changes in EZH2, PHF19, CBX7, CBX6 and EZH1 occurred progressively as astrocytoma grade increased.
PHF19	melanoma	In this report, we show that PHF19 silencing reduces the cell proliferation rate and increases the transendothelial migration capacities of melanoma cell lines.
PHF19	melanoma	Our data therefore indicate the role of PHF19 and its upstream regulator, Akt, in the phenotype switch of melanoma cells from proliferative to invasive states.
hPCL3	cancer	Interestingly, the products of the hPCL3 gene, particularly the short form, hPCL3S, are markedly overexpressed in many types of cancers, including colon, skin, lung, rectal, cervical, uterus, and liver cancers.

TLF	degenerative disc disease	However, the patients with thoracolumbar fracture (TLF) had significantly more MSCs than those with degenerative disc disease (DDD), but not for NCs.
FRDA	ataxia telangiectasia	Common physiological pathways are involved in several ARCA, such as DNA repair deficiency (AOA1, ataxia telangiectasia [AT]...), RNA termination disorder (AOA2), mitochondrial defect (FRDA, sensory ataxic neuropathy with dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia [Sando]...), lipoprotein assembly defects (AVED, abetalipoproteinemia [ABL]), chaperon protein disorders (ARSACS, Marinesco-Sjoegren syndrome [MSS]) or peroxysomal diseases (Refsum disease [RD]).
FRDA	ataxia telangiectasia	While Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) and ataxia telangiectasia (AT) are known to be the two most frequent forms of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia (ARCA), knowledge on the other forms of ARCA has been obtained only recently, and they appear to be rarer.

transcription intermediary factor 1Gamma	ILD	Antibodies to transcription intermediary factor 1Gamma/Alfa (TIF1Gamma/Alfa, p155/140) are frequently found in DM associated with malignancy while anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5; CADM140) are associated with clinically amyopathic DM (CADM) complicated by rapidly progressive ILD.
TIF-1Gamma	interstitial lung disease	Anti-TIF-1Gamma positive patients were less likely to have systemic features including interstitial lung disease, Raynaud phenomenon, and arthritis/arthralgia.
TIF1Gamma	pulmonary fibrosis	The frequency of pulmonary fibrosis during the disease progression was 2/12, 1/4 and 1/4 in anti-TIF1Gamma, anti-NXP2 and anti-SAE, respectively.
Hsp90	SRs	Each of the identified mutations altered the equilibrium between alternative GR conformations distinctively, indicating that the Hsp90 dependence of SRs may correlate with differences in the conformational dynamics of these receptors.
hsp90	SRs	The ubiquitous heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) has been shown to participate directly in the function of a wide variety of cellular signal transduction components, including steroid receptors (SRs).
hsp90	SRs	However, there is still no direct evidence for an in vivo association of SRs with hsp90.
hsp90	SRs	The results suggest that the interaction of SRs with the hsp90 is minimal when compared to a bona fide type of interaction with the co-factors.
AT-2	prostate cancer	To address the role of endothelial Cx43 in this process, we analyzed Cx43 regulation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells in the proximity of Cx43high (DU-145 and MAT-LyLu) and Cx43low prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and AT-2).
AT2	prostate cancer	The data on the nature of AT2-R expression in prostate tissue of prostate cancer patients may be considered as a tool for predicting biochemical recurrence after combined hormone and radiation therapy.
AT-2	prostate cancer	The present study found that, similarly to 5-fluorouracil, low concentrations (1-10 myM) of 9-aminoacridine (9-AAA) inhibited the growth of the two rat prostate cancer AT-2 and Mat-LyLu cell lines and the human melanoma A375 cell line.
AT2	prostate cancer	Furthermore, our previous studies indicate that increased expression of Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) alone induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer lines, an effect that did not require Ang II.
AT2	prostate cancer	Human prostate cancer DU145 xenograft mouse model was used to assess the effect of AT2R on tumor growth in vivo.
AT2	prostate cancer	The results showed that AT2R overexpression can inhibit tumor growth of prostate cancer in vivo by inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells.
AT2	prostate cancer	The aim of the present study was the evaluation of AT1 and AT2 expressions in human prostate cancers.
AT2	prostate cancer	The data on AT1 and AT2 receptor expressions may suggest the involvement of RAS in prostate cancerogenesis.
AT2	prostate cancer	sartanes) and/or AT2 agonists in prostate cancer prophylaxis and/or treatment.
CEGA	esophageal carcinoma	The results indicate that CEGA using the new circular stapling device in surgery of the esophageal carcinoma is a very effective procedure to improve the anastomotic technique from a traditional hand-sewn anastomosis to a stapled anastomosis and can reduce the incidence of complications.
OMI	ophthalmomyiasis	An unusual retinal pigment epitheliopathy resembling ophthalmomyiasis interna posterior (OMI) is endemic to Guam.
CTx	mucositis	Toxicity, such as mucositis, leukocytopenia and neutropenia, was higher in ConcCRTx than in CTx followed by RTx.
Ctx	mucositis	At the 4th dose level (Ctx 1400 mg/m2, Epidx 100 mg/m2, 5-Fu 600 mg/m2), two patients had dose-limiting mucositis and one patient developed dose-limiting neutropenia.
CYP2C9	CKD	Therefore, the effect of CKD on the disposition of CYP1A2-metabolized, CYP2C8-metabolized, CYP2C9-metabolized, CYP2C19-metabolized, and organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)-transported drugs was investigated.
CYP2C9	CKD	We identified dedicated CKD studies with 6, 5, 6, 4, and 12 "model" substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and OATP, respectively.
CYP2C9	CKD	In contrast, the effect of CKD on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 was variable and modest compared to CYP2C8 and OATP.
CYP2C9	lupus nephritis	To investigate the impact of genetic variants in CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 on the efficacy of cyclophosphamide (CYC) therapy in patients with lupus nephritis.
CYP2C9	CKD	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) complicates warfarin anticoagulation partially through its effect on CYP2C9 activity.
CYP2C9	CKD	CKD increased the effect of CYP2C9 genetic variation on (S)-warfarin and (R,S)-warfarin metabolism.
CYP2C9	CKD	Tecarfarin exposure was similar between the HVs and the CKD subjects regardless of CYP2C9 genotype.
CYP2C9	CKD	The CYP2C9 pathway (4-hydroxyflurbiprofen formation clearance) was similar in all the patients with CKD and was concordant with previous reports of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and healthy controls.
CYP2C9	CKD	For flurbiprofen, patients with glomerulonephritis had higher oral clearance than those with nonglomerular CKD, suggesting higher unbound fraction and enhanced metabolism through other (non-CYP2C9) routes.
CYP2C9	CKD	The current study suggests no statistically significant differences in the in vivo activity of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 in patients with either glomerulonephritis or nonglomerular CKD.
ACE	non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy	We examined whether the renin inhibitor, aliskiren, provides similar or greater protection than ACE inhibition from non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and from the proliferative neoangiogenesis of oxygen-induced retinopathy.
ACE	nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy	To assess angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels in aqueous humor and plasma of patients with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) as another potent ischemia-induced angiogenic factor.
ACE	NPDR	We observed significantly elevated ACE level in aqueous humor of patients with PDR compared with the patients with NPDR and normal subjects (P = 0.023), but no significant difference was detected between nonproliferative diabetics and control group (P = 0.239).
ACE	BDR	Studies exploring the association between ACE I/D polymorphism and BDR or PDR may help us better understand the genetics of DR.
ACE	NPDR	To evaluate the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) in retarding progression of severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) in normotensive type 2 diabetic patients.
ACE	NPDR	This was a retrospective case control study of 128 patients with normotensive type 2 diabetes with lower than +1 dipstick proteinuria and severe NPDR who were classified into either an ACE-I treated group (Enalapril maleate 10 mg, n=12 , Ramipril 5 mg, n=17) or an ACE-I untreated group (n=99).
ACE	NPDR	Small doses of ACE-I did not yield any beneficial effects in retarding the progression of severe NPDR.
PHOX2A	cancer	A7730C variant which showed a high mutation frequency in cervical cancer was predicted to be a binding site for the cellular transcription factor PHOX2A.
Phox2a	cancer	miR-326 regulates cell proliferation and migration in lung cancer by targeting Phox2a and is regulated by HOTAIR.
PHOX2A	neuroblastoma	PHOX2B and its paralogue gene PHOX2A are two homeodomain proteins in the network regulating the development of autonomic ganglia that have been associated with the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma (NB), because of their over-expression in different NB cell lines and tumour samples.
PHOX2A	cancer	To identify novel abnormally methylated genes in early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we analyzed the methylation status of 13 genes (ALX1, BCL2, FOXL2, HPP1, MYF6, OC2, PDGFRA, PHOX2A, PITX2, RARB, SIX6, SMPD3 and SOX1) in cancer tissues from 101 cases of stage I NSCLC patients and lung tissues from 30 cases of non-cancerous lung disease controls, using methylation-specific PCR (MSP).
PHOX2A	cancer	The methylation frequencies (29.70-64.36%) of 7 genes (MYF6, SIX6, SOX1, RARB, BCL2, PHOX2A and FOLX2) in stage I NSCLC were significantly higher compared with those in non-cancerous lung disease controls (P&lt;0.05).
PHOX2A	cancer	Furthermore, we also detected the expression of 8 pathological markers (VEGF, HER-2, P53, P21, EGFR, CHGA, SYN and EMA) in cancer tissues of stage I NSCLC by immunohistochemistry, and found that high expression levels of p53 and CHGA were associated with the methylation of BCL2 (P=0.025) and PHOX2A (P=0.023), respectively.
PHOX2A	cancer	In this study, among the 7 genes which demonstrated hypermethylation in stage I NSCLC compared with non-cancerous lung diseases, 5 genes (MYF6, SIX6, PHOX2A, FOLX2 and SOX1) were found for the first time to be abonormally methylated in NSCLC.
Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome	neuropathy	Heteroplasmic m.3697G&gt;A has been reported in patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes and Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome.
Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome	hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy	These can be grouped into disorders with reduced papillae (Machado-Joseph disease, Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome, familial dysautonomia, dystonia musculorum, and Behcet's disease) and those with taste defects only (Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IV, and diabetes mellitus).
neogenin	glaucoma	We used in-situ hybridization to analyze the expression patterns of three known members (a, b and c) of the RGM ("repulsive guidance molecule") gene family and of the RGMa receptor neogenin in a glaucoma mouse model (DBA/2J strain) and the C57BL/6J strain, which served as a control.
neogenin	glaucoma	In order to understand the role of the RGMs and neogenin in glaucoma, we characterized their expression patterns in the developing and mature mouse retina and in the optic nerve.
neogenin	glaucoma	Interestingly, we found a higher expression of RGMa, RGMb and neogenin in the retinas of all glaucoma-affected mice than in the age-matched control strain.
DeAR	dementia	A tool developed for their use--DeAR GP (Dementia Assessment Referral to GP)--empowers care home staff, makes more efficient use of GPs' and specialist memory nurses' time, and improves diagnosis of dementia.
PTH	autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets	Using homozygous mice for an autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets-FGF23 mutation or animals treated with a furin inhibitor, we showed that cFGF23 and iFGF23 levels increased equivalently after PTH injection.
GRx	Alzheimer's disease	We discuss in this review the current implications of GRx and/or glutathionylation in the inflammatory response and in diseases associated with chronic inflammation, namely diabetes, atherosclerosis, inflammatory lung disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease, and in viral infections.
DAZ	Klinefelter syndrome	In addition to arising from the procedure per se, a genetic or cytogenetic abnormality in offspring of an ICSI pregnancy could arise as result of offspring inheriting the mutant gene or chromosomal abnormality conferring paternal infertility: Y deletions (DAZ) in oligospermia males, cystic fibrosis in offspring of males with congenital bilateral absence vas deferens (CBAVD), and sex chromosomal abnormalities in offspring of Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) males.
Fgfr1	bipolar disorder	Two recent candidate genes, ErbB3 and Fgfr1, are growth factors whose mRNA levels have been found to be altered in the leukocytes of patients that are affected by bipolar disorder in a depressive state.
FGFR1	bipolar disorder	Molecular genetics and developmental studies have identified 21 genes in this region (ADRA1A, ARHGEF10, CHRNA2, CHRNA6, CHRNB3, DKK4, DPYSL2, EGR3, FGF17, FGF20, FGFR1, FZD3, LDL, NAT2, NEF3, NRG1, PCM1, PLAT, PPP3CC, SFRP1 and VMAT1/SLC18A1) that are most likely to contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, autism, bipolar disorder and depression), neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease) and cancer.
3p25	familial renal cell carcinoma	The region on chromosome 3p13-p14 known to contain several chromosomal translocation breakpoints in families with "pure familial renal cell carcinoma" is quite proximal to the VHL locus in 3p25-p26 we have identified.
gamma 9	mycosis fungoides	Immunohistochemical studies and TCR gamma gene rearrangement analysis using a polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for V gamma 1-8 and V gamma 9 gene segments in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR/ DGGE) were performed on frozen material of 11 pseudo-T-cell lymphomas and 17 CTCLs, including 9 cases of mycosis fungoides (MF) and 8 pleomorphic CTCLs.
gamma 9	cutaneous T-cell lymphoma	Unclassifiable cutaneous T-cell lymphoma was also diagnosed in the second patient: it was associated with a monoclonal proliferation of T-cell receptor V gamma 9, delta + large granular T lymphocytes and finally developed into frank, acute pre-T lymphatic leukemia.
Pol I	trypanosomiasis	In addition to providing insight into Pol I transcription and ES control, Pol I transcription inhibitors potentially also provide new approaches to treat trypanosomiasis.
Pol I	sleeping sickness	In the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African sleeping sickness, TbISWI down-regulates RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-transcribed variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) gene expression sites (ESs), which are monoallelically expressed.
perilipin	obesity	A significant association was found between the perilipin rs1052700 polymorphism and T2D, and between the FTO rs3751812 polymorphism and obesity (P = 0.03 and 0.003, respectively); however, no significant relationship was found between rs3751812 and T2D.
perilipin	obesity	The perilipin rs1052700 polymorphism is related to T2D but not obesity.
CYP3A5	ESRD	This prospective study recruited 22 patients with ESRD who underwent a first living kidney allograft transplantation, comprising 12 patients with CYP3A5*1 allele (CYP3A5*1/*1 or *1/*3) and 10 patients without CYP3A5*1 allele (CYP3A5*3/*3).
CYP3A5	nephrolithiasis	Nineteen SNPs in the ABCB1, NR1I2, UGT1A1, SLCO1B1 and CYP3A5 genes were examined in case patients with atazanavir/ritonavir-induced nephrolithiasis (n = 31) and controls (n = 47).
CYP3A5	CKD	Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) use is considered to play a major role in the development of CKD after LT. We studied the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes of the donor and recipient CNI-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A5 and the CNI-transporting ABCB1 on the development of CKD after LT. Tacrolimus (Tac) predose concentrations at different time-points after transplantation and the CYP3A5 6986A&gt;G and ABCB1 3435C&gt;T SNPs were determined in 125 LT recipients and their respective donors to study the influence of Tac predose levels and genetics on the development of CKD.
CYP3A5	CKD	Neither did we find a correlation between the investigated SNPs in either donor or recipient ABCB1 and CYP3A5 genes (or combinations thereof) and the development of CKD.
CYP3A5	CKD	An individual's risk of developing CKD after LT is not associated with genetic variation in either recipient or donor CYP3A5 or ABCB1 genotype status.
CYP3A5	renal failure	In conclusion, these results suggest that CYP3A5 polymorphism and plasma concentration of 3-INDS may account for the interindividual variability of CYP3A activity, and that plasma concentration of 3-INDS may partially explain the gap in CYP3A activity that cannot be explained by genetic contribution in patients with renal failure.

albumin	Alport syndrome	Filtered albumin has been suggested to be a cause of the glomerular and tubular injuries observed at advanced stages of Alport syndrome.
albumin	Alport syndrome	To directly investigate the role that albumin plays in the progression of disease in Alport syndrome, we generated albumin knockout (Alb(-/-)) mice to use as a tool for removing albuminuria as a component of kidney disease.
Alb	Alport syndrome	Alb mutant mice were bred to collagen-Alfa3(IV) knockout (Col4a3(-/-)) mice, which are a model for human Alport syndrome.
albumin	Alport syndrome	We conclude that filtered albumin is injurious to kidney cells in Alport syndrome and perhaps in other proteinuric kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy.
VEGF	tongue cancer	On the other hand, we believe that tumor depth of invasion (&gt;=4 mm), POI, and VEGF-C expression all need to be considered in the preoperative and postoperative planning stages for tongue cancer treatment.
VEGF	tongue cancer	The use of a therapeutic approach which blocks lymphangiogenic factors, such as VEGF-C and VEGF-D, may be beneficial in suppressing the lymphatic spread of tongue cancer with intense intranodal lymphangiogenesis.
VEGF	tongue cancer	VEGF, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and MIA expression levels of metastatic tongue cancer HSC-3 cells were higher than those with no metastatic HSC-4 cells, and VEGF, VEGF-C and VEGF-D expression levels were decreased by MIA siRNA treatment in both cells.
Vascular endothelial growth factor	tongue cancer	Vascular endothelial growth factor and Notch1 expression are significantly related to cervical lymph node metastasis and depth of invasion in tongue cancer patients.
VEGF	tongue cancer	Mutant-type p53 and VEGF are known to be related to angiogenesis, and maspin is a potent angiogenic inhibitor but its role in tongue cancer has scarcely been examined.
VEGF	tongue cancer	We observed the expression of maspin, mutant-type p53 and VEGF by immunohistochemistry in 33 patients with stages I and II oral tongue cancer.
mELT	encephalomyelitis	In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of CNS autoimmunity, we found activation-induced cytidine deaminase, a GC-defining enzyme, in meningeal ELT (mELT) densely populated by B and T cells.
oxytocin	amenorrhea	A prospective randomized survey of 113 abortions carried out by 1 operator using a single technique among women in the 7th-10th week of amenorrhea was undertaken to test the effectiveness of systemically administered oxytocins to reduce bleeding during therapeutic abortion by suction.
ADO	diabetes	This cross-sectional study includes 304 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (ADOs) and a glomerular filtration rate (estimated GFR) &amp;lt;60ml/min/1.73m2.
ADO	diabetes	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that acute hyperglycaemia in hearts of rats without diabetes alters coronary vascular responses to nitric oxide (NO), adenosine (ADO) and phenylephrine (PHE).
ADO	diabetes mellitus	In conclusion, STZ-diabetes mellitus enhances the antiphosphaturic effect of ADO by mechanisms unrelated to ADO A1 receptor stimulation.
Bradykinin	obesity	Bradykinin type 1 receptor antagonism could represent a promising therapeutic tool in combination with TZD for the treatment of T2D, obesity and insulin resistance.
bradykinin	type 2 diabetes mellitus	The aim of this study was to analyze the acute responses of bradykinin, insulin, and glycemia to exercise performed above and below lactate threshold (LT) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D).
bradykinin	diabetes	To examine the association of bradykinin and related peptides with the development of diabetic nephropathy lesions in 243 participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D) from the Renin-Angiotensin System Study who, at baseline, were normoalbuminuric, normotensive and had normal or increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
CGL2	neuropathy	Heterozygosity for missense mutations in Seipin, namely N88S and S90L, leads to a broad spectrum of motor neuropathy, while a number of loss-of-function mutations in Seipin are associated with the Berardinelli-Seip congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 2 (CGL2, BSCL2), a condition that is characterized by severe lipoatrophy, insulin resistance, and intellectual impairment.
IL-28A	liver disease	In comparison to liver biopsies of patients with non-viral liver disease, liver biopsies of patients with HCV showed significantly increased mRNA expression of IL-28A and IL-29.
IL-28A	hepatitis	Here, we demonstrate a key regulatory role of IL-28A in T-cell-mediated hepatitis.
IL-28A	hepatitis	IL-28A induced TH1 cytokine production by CD4+ T lymphocytes in a T-bet-dependent manner and was up-regulated in a murine model of T-cell-mediated hepatitis upon Con A administration.
IL-28A	hepatitis	In addition, IL-28A-transgenic mice showed markedly augmented Con A-induced hepatitis with up-regulated interferon-gamma cytokine production, as compared with wild-type mice.
IL-28A	hepatitis	In addition, in vivo blockade of interferon-gamma but not IL-4 suppressed augmented liver inflammation in transgenic mice, suggesting that IL-28A induces the T-bet signaling pathway in T-cell-induced hepatitis.
IL-28A	hepatitis	Thus, targeting of IL-28A represents a potential novel approach for therapy of Th1-mediated inflammatory diseases such as T-cell-mediated hepatitis.
TLR9	acute pancreatitis	The present study therefore indicated that NOD receptor and TLR9 may modulate the inflammatory response and further impact upon intestinal injury of SAP, via the regulation of NF-KB expression and the oxidation/antioxidation balance, suggesting therapeutically targeting NOD receptor and TLR9 might be a useful approach for the treatment of severe acute pancreatitis.
TLR9	acute pancreatitis	It also has efficacy in limiting TLR9-mediated sterile inflammation in in vivo models of acute liver injury and acute pancreatitis.
TLR9	acute pancreatitis	Genetic deletion and pharmacologic antagonism demonstrate that specific DAMP receptors, including Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, TLR9, and P2X7, are also required for inflammation in experimental acute pancreatitis.
Toll-like receptor 9	Acute pancreatitis	Acute pancreatitis was induced by caerulein stimulation in wild-type mice and mice deficient in components of the inflammasome (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain [ASC], NLRP3, caspase-1), Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), or the purinergic receptor P2X(7).
TLR9	acute pancreatitis	Additionally, wild-type mice were pretreated with a TLR9 antagonist before induction of acute pancreatitis by caerulein or retrograde bile duct infusion of taurolithocholic acid 3-sulfate.
TLR9	acute pancreatitis	TLR9 and P2X(7) are important DAMP receptors upstream of inflammasome activation, and their antagonism could provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating acute pancreatitis.
QSOX2	DFNB79	We are currently screening the 113 candidate DFNB79 genes for mutations and have excluded CACNA1B, EDF1, PTGDS, EHMT1, QSOX2, NOTCH1, MIR126 and MIR602.
CD184	neuroblastoma	Exposure to bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 was found to enhance a TrkAhigh/CD15-/CD184- neuroblastoma cellular subset, accompanied by a reduction in doublecortin-positive neuroblasts and of NMYC protein expression in SH-SY5Y cells.
CXCR4	malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor	Recent studies indicate that C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) and its ligand, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12), stimulate expression of the cell cycle regulatory protein Cyclin D1 in neurofibromatosis 1-associated malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells and promote their proliferation.
CXCR4	neuroblastoma	Western blot analysis revealed the expression of multiple CXCR4 isoforms in neuroblastoma cells.
CXCR4	neuroblastoma	Our data suggest a modulatory role of the MSC secretome on the expression of the 47 kDa CXCR4 isoform and invasion potential of the neuroblastoma cells to the bone marrow.
CXCR4	neuroblastoma	In this study, we investigated the role of NF-KB signaling pathway in the regulation of CXC chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) in neuroblastoma metastasis.
CXCR4	neuroblastoma	Targeting NF-KB signalling pathways and ultimately CXCR4 could be a strategy in neuroblastoma therapy.
FAM3C	breast cancer	The FAM3C interleukin-like epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) inducer (ILEI) has been shown to be strongly up-regulated in several cancers and to be essential for tumor formation and metastasis in epithelial cells, correlating with a significant decrease in overall survival in colon and breast cancer patients.
ILEI	breast cancer	Interleukin-like epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition inducer (ILEI) is an essential cytokine in tumor progression that is upregulated in several cancers, and its altered subcellular localization is a predictor of poor survival in human breast cancer.
ILEI	mammary tumor	Murine mammary tumor and metastasis models of EpC40 and 4T1 cells overexpressing different mutant forms of ILEI were used-extended with in vivo aprotinin treatment for the inhibition of ILEI-processing proteases-to test the in vivo relevance of proteolytic cleavage.
ILEI	breast cancer	Immunohistochemistry for ILEI localization and uPAR expression was performed on two human breast cancer arrays, and ILEI and uPAR scores were correlated with the metastasis-free survival of patients.
ILEI	breast cancer	Moreover, altered subcellular ILEI localization strongly correlates with high tumor cell-associated uPAR protein expression, as well as with poor survival, in human breast cancer.
ILEI	breast cancer	Our findings point out extracellular serine proteases, in particular plasmin, and uPAR as valuable therapeutic targets against ILEI-driven tumor progression and emphasize the prognostic relevance of ILEI localization and a combined ILEI-uPAR marker analysis in human breast cancer.
ILEI	breast cancer	ILEI is overexpressed and/or altered in intracellular localization in multiple human tumors, an event strongly correlated to invasion/EMT, metastasis formation, and survival in human colon and breast cancer.
EB-3	Burkitt's lymphoma	Keeping in view the fact that molecular basis of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is poorly understood, we attempted to explore the small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated c-myc gene regulation using BL-derived EB-3 cell line as archetype cellular model.
EB3	Burkitt lymphoma	With other procedures, as anti-complement immunoperoxidase (ACIP) and anti-IgG immunoperoxidase (AIIP) the Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen (EBNA) was detected precisely in EB3, Jijoye and Raji lymphocytes using anti-EBNA antibodies from patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma or Burkitt lymphoma, in dilution 1:10-1:5120.
EB-3	Burkitt lymphoma	The virus in the EB-3 cell line derived from a Burkitt lymphoma was partially purified by digestion with proteolytic enzyme and by density-gradient centrifugation on potassium tartrate.
EB-3	Burkitt lymphoma	This conjugate proved to be a potent cytotoxin for surface Ig positive Burkitt lymphoma EB-3 cells, growing in vitro and produced 50% inhibition of protein synthesis at level of 1.4 x 10(-9) M. When tested for cytotoxic action on target cells, the composite conjugate molecule was at least 100 times more effective than antibodies alone, ricin A-chain alone or a conjugate ricin A-chain--normal rabbit IgG.
EB-3	Burkitt lymphoma	The interaction of poly- and monoclonal antibodies against the L-chain of human Ig with Burkitt lymphoma EB-3 cells was studied using a fluorescent lipid probe, anthrylvinyl-labelled sphingomyelin, incorporated into the cell plasma membrane.
EB-3	Burkitt's lymphoma	The only gangliosides in Burkitt's lymphoma EB-3 cells is GM3.
EB-3	Burkitt's lymphoma	Treatment of Burkitt's lymphoma EB-3 cells with gangliosides GM1 or GM3 results in their binding to and partial incorporation into the cell membrane.
CIRP	circulatory arrest	We sought to investigate the renoprotection of CIRP in a rat model of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
CIRP	circulatory arrest	Overexpression and knockdown of CIRP were achieved in vivo by directly injecting lentivirus vectors containing packaging lentivirus (pL)/internal ribosome entry site (IRES)/green fluorescent protein (GFP)-CIRP or pL/short hairpin RNA (shRNA)/F-cold inducible RNA binding protein (F-CIRP)-A into the renal parenchyma of rats 7 days before deep hypothermic circulatory arrest under the ultrasound guidance.
CIRP	circulatory arrest	Our findings suggest that the CIRP exerts a robust renoprotective effect by inhibiting apoptosis in the rat model of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
CIRP	cardiac arrest	Compared with baseline, rats resuscitated from cardiac arrest showed increased expression of CIRP, Bax, Caspase 9, and Caspase 3 and decreased expression of Bcl-2 in hippocampus (P &lt; 0.05).
CIRP	cardiac arrest	Our findings suggest that 32 C therapeutic hypothermia exerts an important neuroprotective effects by up-regulating CIRP expression and inhibiting mitochondrial apoptosis factor production in the cardiac arrest rat model.
VGLL3	cancer	A previously reported expression signature of three genes (IGFBP3, F3 and VGLL3) was shown to have potential prognostic value in estimating overall and cancer-specific survivals at diagnosis of prostate cancer in a pilot cohort study using freshly frozen Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) samples.
VGLL3	cancer	Multiple biopsy samples from 43 patients were evaluated using a previously reported gene signature of IGFBP3, F3 and VGLL3 with potential prognostic value in estimating overall survival at diagnosis of prostate cancer.

BB x	diabetes	Treatment of (DR-BB x WF)F1 x WF animals (all lyp+/+) using a standard induction protocol caused type 1 diabetes in 58% of progeny.
BB x	diabetes	All genetic analyses of BB rat diabetes to date have backcrossed to the DP-BB strain or used (DP-BB x non-BB)F2 animals to ensure that a fraction of progeny are homozygous for lyp.
BB x	diabetes	Since, type 1 diabetes is characterised by hyperglycaemia we analysed 22 diabetic and 43 non-diabetic [(BB x SHR)FI x BB] backcross hybrids (28M:37F) which were already homozygous for Iddml and Iddm2 to search for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting blood glucose in BB/OK rats.
BB x	IDDM	This prompted us to investigate the inheritance of IDDM in two subpopulations of BB rats (BB/OK and BB/PhiK) by crossing studies with the production of (diabetic BB x LEW 1.A) F1, F2 generations and of first backcross hybrids onto BB (B1BB) and LEW.1A (B1A) rats respectively.

FAIM2	obesity	In total, 15 loci reached genome-wide significance (P-value &lt; 5 x 10(-8)) in the joint discovery and replication analysis, of which 12 are previously identified loci in or close to ADCY3, GNPDA2, TMEM18, SEC16B, FAIM2, FTO, TFAP2B, TNNI3K, MC4R, GPR61, LMX1B and OLFM4 associated with adult body mass index or childhood obesity.
FAIM2	obesity	An obesity-related gene, Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 2 (FAIM2), is regulated by nutritional state and the methylation levels of the FAIM2 promoter are significantly associated with obesity.
FAIM2	obesity	Whether the molecular mechanisms by which FAIM2 affects obesity are involved in lifestyle is unclear.
FAIM2	obesity	Our results suggest that lifestyle may possibly be mediating the process of the FAIM2 involved in obesity.

p130	breast cancer	Here we show a new molecular mechanism of ER-alpha gene inactivation mediated by pRb2/p130 in ER-negative breast cancer cells.
p130	breast cancer	These findings suggest that pRb2/p130-multimolecular complexes can be key elements in the regulation of ER-alpha gene expression and may be viewed as promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in the treatment of breast cancer, especially for those tumors that are ER negative.
Rb2	mammary carcinoma	In order to further analyze the role of CEACAM1 in the development of breast cancer, we performed Western-blot analysis and immunohistochemistry with highly specific monoclonal antibodies in a cohort of 68 mammary carcinomas which had also been analyzed for expression of cell-cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1, cyclin E, p16, p21, p27, Rb, and Rb2, as well as for steroid hormone receptor status, Ki67, and HER2/neu immunoreactivity.
Rb2	mammary carcinoma	Weak or absent Rb2 expression was more often found in endometrial (59%) than in mammary carcinomas (24%).
Rb2	breast cancer	We found significant positive correlations of Rb2 expression with Rb, ER, and PR-B in breast cancer samples, and of Rb2 with Rb, PR-A, PR-B, and younger age in endometrial carcinomas.
Rb2	mammary carcinoma	Our results indicate that loss of Rb2 expression, mostly by transcriptional down-regulation, may be associated with the development and dedifferentiation of most endometrial and a subset of mammary carcinomas.

RAG1	IL7R	Mutations in any of eight known genes: IL2RG, ARTEMIS, RAG1, RAG2, ADA, CD45, JAK3, and IL7R cause SCID.
Nit2	cancer	Previous studies have reported that Nit2, a member of the nitrilase superfamily, is a potential tumor suppressor, although its function remains elusive in colon cancer.
NIT2	cancer	In the present study, we employed an RNA interference lentivirus system to silence endogenous NIT2 expression in the colon cancer cell line, HCT116.
NIT2	cancer	The depletion of NIT2 markedly inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation and colony formation and induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, as shown by MTT assay, colony formation assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively.
NIT2	cancer	Further investigation with an intracellular signaling array demonstrated that the depletion of NIT2 triggered the apoptosis of colon cancer cells through the caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) pathways.
NIT2	cancer	Our findings suggest that NIT2 may be an oncogene in human colon cancer and may thus serve as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of colon cancer.
Nit2	cancer	Our report may provide clues regarding the nature of the biological amidase substrate(s) of Nit1 (another member of the Nit family), which is a well-established tumor suppressor protein), and emphasizes a) the crucial role of Nit2 in nitrogen and sulfur metabolism, and b) the possible link of Nit2 to cancer biology.

1H-MR	prostate cancer	MRI, dynamic MRI, and 1H-MR spectroscopic imaging were performed in 10 patients with prostate cancer on 1.5T and 3T whole-body scanners.
1H-MR	prostate cancer	Initial results of endorectal 3T 1H-MR spectroscopic imaging in prostate cancer patients showed potential advantages: the increase in spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution at higher field strength may result in an improved accuracy in delineating and staging prostate cancer.
1H-MR	prostate cancer	To establish an experimental setting for monitoring perfusion and metabolism in orthotopic prostate cancer at 1.5 T using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI) and 1H-MR spectroscopy (MRS).

b in 2	epididymo-orchitis	We report the coexistence of otitis media and epididymo-orchitis owing to Hemophilus influenzae, type b in 2 children.
Nogo	neuroblastoma	Overexpression of tau rescued the Nogo-66-induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma 2a (N2a) cells and primary cortical neurons.
Nogo	neuroblastoma	Taken together, we suggest that Nogo-A is closely involved in the neuronal response to hypoxic and oxidative stress, an observation that may be of relevance not only in stroke-induced ischaemia, but also in neuroblastoma formation.
Nogo	neuroblastoma	In the present study, we report on the role of GSK-3Beta signaling on Nogo-66-treated mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells.
Nogo	neuroblastoma	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor stimulates the phosphorylation, suppressing Nogo-dependent inhibition of neurite outgrowth from neuroblastoma-derived neural cells.

S100A10	adenocarcinomas	The aims of the present study were to immunohistochemically examine S100A10 expression in surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas, and evaluate any relationships with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis of patients.
S100A10	adenocarcinomas	S100A10 expression was immunohistochemically studied in 202 consecutive resected lung adenocarcinomas, and its associations with clinicopathological parameters were evaluated.
S100A10	adenocarcinomas	S100A10 expression was detected in 65 of the 202 (32.2%) lung adenocarcinomas, being significantly correlated with poorer differentiation (P =0.015), a higher pathological TNM stage (stages II and III) (P=0.004), more frequent and severe intratumoral vascular invasion (P=0.001), and a poorer prognosis (P=0.030).
S100A10	adenocarcinomas	The present study reveals that S100A10 is expressed in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas, and this is related to some clinicopathological parameters, although further studies are required to confirm the correlation between S100A10 expression and prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients.
S100-A10	adenocarcinoma	Using mass spectrometry for protein identification and validating the results by immunohistochemistry on an independent validation set, we could identify two of 60 differentially expressed m/z species between Barrett's adenocarcinoma and the precursor lesion: COX7A2 and S100-A10.
S100-A10	adenocarcinoma	In the validation set, we found a correlation of the expression levels of COX7A2 and TAGLN2 with a poor prognosis while S100-A10 was confirmed by multivariate analysis as a novel independent prognostic factor in Barrett's adenocarcinoma.
S100A10	carcinoma	S100A10, a member of the S100 family, forms a heterotetramer with annexin IIH and promotes carcinoma invasion and metastasis by plasminogen activation.
S100A10	carcinoma	Cells stained positively in 14.6% and 20.8% of follicular carcinomas for S100A10 and annexin II, respectively, but their expression levels were always low.
S100A10	papillary carcinoma	S100A10 and annexin II were expressed in all papillary carcinomas, but 88.2% and 82.8% ofpapillary carcinomas were classified in the low group.
S100A10	papillary carcinoma	These findings suggest that S100A10 and annexin II contribute to the aggressive characteristics of anaplastic carcinoma, while playing a constitutive role in papillary carcinoma.
GP-11	carcinoma	The spin-labeled derivative of podophyllotoxin, N'-podophyllic acid-N-[3-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl pyrrolinenyloxy)] semicarbazide (GP-11), was synthesized and tested for its antitumor activity against mouse transplantable tumors, Sarcoma-180, Hepatoma-A, P388 leukemia and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma.
tissue-type plasminogen activator	cerebral amyloid angiopathy	Remote parenchymal hemorrhage (rPH) after intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator may be associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, although supportive data are limited.

Interferon regulatory factor 1	cancer	Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) has been suggested to act as a tumor suppressor in human cancers.
IRF1	cholangiocarcinoma	However, the clinical significance and biological function of IRF1 in cholangiocarcinoma is poorly understood.
IRF1	cholangiocarcinoma	In our results, IRF1 mRNA and protein expressions were decreased in cholangiocarcinoma tissues and cell lines compared with paired normal hepatic tissues and intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cell line.
IRF1	cholangiocarcinoma	IRF1 protein low-expression was associated with tumor stage, tumor size, vascular invasion and metastasis and served as a poor independent prognostic parameter in cholangiocarcinoma patients.
IRF1	cholangiocarcinoma	Up-regulation of IRF1 expression suppressed cholangiocarcinoma cells proliferation, migration and invasion, and blocked cell cycle progression, but has no effect on apoptosis.
IRF1	cholangiocarcinoma	In conclusion, IRF1 is low-expressed in cholangiocarcinoma tissues and cell lines, and correlated with malignant status and prognosis in cholangiocarcinoma patients.
IRF1	cholangiocarcinoma	IRF1 served as tumor suppressor in the regulation of cholangiocarcinoma cells proliferation, cell cycle, migration and invasion.
IRF1	lung squamous cell carcinoma	To examine genetic defects of the IFNGamma-IRF1 pathway in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma (LuAd) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LuSc) data.
IRF1	NSCLC	IRF1 expression was correlated with immune cytolytic activity markers GZMA and PRF1 in NSCLC.
IRF1	NSCLC	Deletion of JAK2 or inhibition of the JAK2 kinase activity resulted in loss of IFNGamma-induced IRF1 and cell surface HLA-ABC in JAK2 wildtype NSCLC cells, whereas expression of exogenous JAK2 in H1573 cells restored the IFNGamma responses.
IRF1	NSCLC	These findings show that JAK2 deficiency is the major mechanism of genetic defects of the IFNGamma-IRF1 pathway in NSCLC and reveal a previously unrecognized significance of chromosome 9p deletion in NSCLC.
ANXA10	Bladder Cancer	Performance of the investigational use only-labeled GeneXpert(R) (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) Bladder Cancer Assay, an assay for detection of the five mRNAs (ABL1, CRH, IGF2, ANXA10, and UPK1B), was evaluated in an independent test cohort (n=450).
ANXA10	carcinoma	Our previous mass spectrometry-based proteomics study revealed that annexin A10 (ANXA10) was uniquely overexpressed in pancreatic CD24+ adenocarcinoma cells that were dissected from clinical PDAC tissues but was absent in CD24- adjacent normal cells.
ANXA10	cancer	The correlation between ANXA10 expression and the progression of pancreatic cancer remains unknown.
ANXA10	pancreatic adenocarcinoma	In this study, we performed an immunostaining assay to evaluate ANXA10 expression in 155 primary human tissue specimens, including normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis (CP), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN, the most important precursor of PDAC), and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN).
ANXA10	cancer	Since PDAC develops through a series of PanINs which in turn arise from pancreatic ducts, the consistent overexpression of ANXA10 in ductal epithelial cells in PanINs and PDACs but negative in normal pancreatic ducts suggests that ANXA10 could serve as a potential marker indicating the presence of PDAC at its earliest precancerous stages.
ANXA10	prostate cancer	In this study, we evaluated the effects of simvastatin on ANXA10 signaling in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.
ANXA10	prostate cancer	In human prostate biopsy samples, ANXA10 mRNA expression was significantly lower in the prostate cancer group than in the BPH group.
ANXA10	carcinoma	Next, we found that up-regulation of ANXA10 in PC-3 resulted in down-regulation of S100 calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4), which is reportedly correlated with aggressiveness and a worse prognosis for patients with different types of carcinomas.
ANXA10	prostate cancer	Our results suggest that statins inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by up-regulation of ANXA10.
ANXA10	carcinoma	Immunohistochemistry for 7 gastric-type markers (ANXA10, VSIG1, CLDN18, CTSE, TFF2, MUC5AC, and MUC6) and 2 intestinal-type markers (CDX2 and CK20) was performed in 36 normal gastric/colorectal mucosa tissues, 163 colorectal polyps, and 175 microsatellite-unstable colorectal carcinomas (MSI-H CRCs).
Galectin-8	prostate carcinoma	Two decades ago, Galectin-8 was described as a prostate carcinoma biomarker since it is only expressed in the neoplastic prostate, but not in the healthy tissue.
Galectin-8	prostate cancer	In this study we silenced Galectin-8 in two human prostate cancer cell lines, PC3 and IGR-CaP1, and designed a pre-clinical experimental model that allows monitoring the pathology from its early steps to the long-term metastatic stages.
Gal-8	prostate cancer	We show for the first time that the natural and conserved expression of Gal-8 in tumour cells is responsible for the metastatic evolution of prostate cancer.
Galectin-8	prostate cancer	Collectively, our results highlight Galectin-8 as a potential target for anti-metastatic therapy against prostate cancer.
PCTA-1	prostate carcinoma	Immunocytochemistry for prostate carcinoma tumour antigen (PCTA-1) was performed for culture purity evaluation.
Galectin-8	prostate cancer	Galectin-8 levels of expression positively correlate with certain human neoplasms, prostate cancer being the best example studied thus far.
PCTA-1	prostate cancer	The Prostate Carcinoma Tumor Antigen-1 (PCTA-1) is located at the prostate cancer susceptibility locus on chromosome 1q42.2-43 (PCaP).
PCTA-1	prostate cancer	Seventy-seven familial prostate cancer cases from 36 German and French pedigrees were screened for germline mutations in the PCTA-1 gene using enzymatic mutation detection (EMD).
PCTA-1	prostate cancer	PCTA-1 is not a classical high risk gene with deleterious mutations predisposing to hereditary prostate cancer.

PHR	diabetes	Fifty-nine patients with type 2 diabetes were interviewed 3-6 months after receiving initial training on a free-of-charge, Web-based PHR.
PHR	diabetes mellitus	The objective of this paper is to describe the design and implementation of a Personal Health Record System (PHR-S) for supporting monitoring of blood glucose in diabetes mellitus type 2 patients.
RPB2	IGS	In this study the different applications and functionalities of the program are demonstrated such as: exhaustive assembly (rDNA region and mitochondrial genome), extracting homologous regions or genes (IGS, RPB1, RPB2 and TEF1a), as well as extracting multiple regions within a single run.
rpb2	IGS	Sequences of the translation elongation factor 1Alfa (tef1Alfa), RNA polymerase II subunit B2 (rpb2), ATP citrate lyase subunit A (acla), and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions were monomorphic, while the intergenic spacer (IGS) region showed length polymorphisms at two minisatellites of 23 and 39 nucleotides (nt).
rpb2	IGS	The phylogenetic relationships of these species were determined using sequences from the ITS and IGS region of the nuclear rRNA gene complex, two nuclear genes ( Beta -tubulin (benA) and RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2)) and two mitochondrial genes (small rRNA subunit (rns) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox1)) and, where available, related sequences from databases.
rpb2	IGS	The combined use of the three commonly employed nuclear genes (benA, rpb2, and ITS), the IGS region, and two less often used mitochondrial gene sequences (rns and cox1) as a single unit resolved several taxonomic ambiguities.
rpb2	IGS	In order to find other markers that, in combination with the ITS rDNA region can be used for species identification in Cladonia, we studied the loci IGS rDNA, ef1Alfa, rpb2 and cox1.
rpb2	IGS	Three-gene combined analyses (ITS+IGS+rpb2) were performed and the results indicated that the Chinese 'G.
RPB2	IGS	Seven loci were analyzed: the translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene (EF-1Alfa); the nuclear rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS), large subunit (LSU), and intergenic spacer (IGS) regions; the second largest subunit of the RNA polymerase gene (RPB2); the calmodulin gene (CAM); and the mitochondrial small subunit (mtSSU) rRNA gene.
RPB2	IGS	Twenty-nine IGS, 27 EF-1Alfa, 26 RPB2, 24 CAM, 18 ITS, 19 LSU, and 18 mtSSU haplotypes were identified; 29 were unique, and haplotypes for 24 clinical strains were novel.
STAT6	pleomorphic liposarcoma	Complete absence of STAT6 was most common in pleomorphic liposarcoma and alveolar soft part sarcoma (60% and 72% cases negative, respectively).
EST 1	choledocholithiasis	Patients with ASC due to choledocholithiasis were allocated to two groups: Those who underwent EST immediately and those who underwent EBD followed by EST 1 wk later because they were under anticoagulant therapy, had a coagulopathy (international normalized ratio &gt; 1.3, partial thromboplastin time greater than twice that of control), or had a platelet count &lt; 50000 x 10(3)/myL.
asci	Asd-4	A cross of the Asd-4 mutant with wild-type resulted in fruiting bodies that appeared to be normal macroscopically but which were complete devoid of asci and ascospores.
asci	asd-1	A mutant strain (asd-1) with a recessive crossing defect (apparently caused by the RIP process) was isolated; in this strain, early development is normal and may asci are formed, but ascospores are never delineated.
cPGES	gastritis	cPGES and mPGES-2 have been found expressed in normal gastric mucosa, with no change in expression levels seen in gastritis or gastric ulcer tissue.
Chk1	male breast cancer	Herein we investigated the ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 signalings in male breast cancer (MBC).
cell-cycle-checkpoint kinase	male breast cancer	We have previously shown that the1100delC variant of the cell-cycle-checkpoint kinase gene CHEK2, which is carried by approximately 1% of the population confers a two-fold increase in female breast cancer and a 10-fold increase in male breast cancer.
IL-19	nephropathy	The purpose of present study was to investigate the relation of serum interleukin-19 (IL-19) levels with diabetic nephropathy (DN).
IL-19	nephropathy	IL-19 is significantly positive correlated with UAE and Cystatin C. IL-19 may play an important role that contributes to the progression of diabetic nephropathy.
IL-19	kidney disease	We also demonstrate a large increase in levels of IL-19 in urine of patients with chronic kidney disease, which significantly correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate levels.
protocadherins	autism	Non-clustered protocadherins (PCDHs) are calcium-dependent adhesion molecules which have attracted attention for their possible roles in the neuronal circuit formation during development and their implications in the neurological disorders such as autism and mental retardation.
PCDH11	autism	Mutation screening of 30 individuals with autism identified two PCDH11Y polymorphic amino acid changes, F885V and K980N.
HUC	bladder cancer	In the present study, we analyzed the expression levels of LETM1 in bladder cancer tissues and non-cancerous tissues as well as in four bladder cancer cell lines (T24, EJ, 5637 and J82) and a human bladder epithelial immortalized cell line SV-HUC-1.
HUC	bladder cancer	The PD-L1 mRNA and protein expression levels were measured in the bladder cancer T24 cell line and the human uroepithelial SV-HUC-1 cell line, following treatment with interleukin (IL)-2, interferon (IFN)-Alfa and IFN-Gamma, by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively.
HUC	bladder cancer	RT-qPCR and western blotting demonstrated that cytokines IL-2, IFN-Alfa and IFN-Gamma markedly upregulated PD-L1 mRNA expression rates and protein levels in bladder cancer T24 cells (P&lt;0.05), but had no significant effect in non-tumor SV-HUC-1 cells.
HUC	bladder cancer	Our data showed that miR-6838 was sharply up-regulated in the bladder tissues from bladder cancer patients and 4 human bladder cancer cell lines, compared with the healthy volunteers and SU-HUC-1 human normal bladder epithelial cells.
HUC	cancer	Treatment with dioscin decreased viability of BC 5637 and T24 cells, but not non-cancer bladder epithelial cell, SV-HUC-1.
C or S	cerebral thrombosis	A primary deficiency of protein C or S is proposed which would produce cerebral thrombosis with exposure of phospholipids; this thrombosis then, like antigens, would generate antibodies acting on the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex, exacerbating the thrombotic process.
SPATA17	azoospermia	To investigate whether defects in the SPATA17 gene are associated with azoospermia due to meiotic arrest, a mutational analysis was conducted, in which the SPATA17 coding regions of 18 Japanese patients with this condition were sequenced.
HLA-A	epiglottitis	The frequencies of erythrocyte MNSs antigens and certain histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) specificities (HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR) were determined in white patients with meningitis or epiglottitis due to Haemophilus influenzae type b and in controls.
CD10	thymoma	Analysis of antigen expression pattern, the presence or absence of T cell-associated antigen deletion, and the expression of CD10 and CD34 by 4-color flow cytometry can help differentiate thymoma from T-cell ALL/LBL.
CYC1	breast tumor	We found that CYC1 was upregulated in breast tumor tissues, especially in tissues with lymph node metastasis.
CYC1	cancer	And higher expression of CYC1 correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients using online databases and tools.
CYC1	cancer	Then we confirmed that CYC1 contributed to metastasis and proliferation in two highly metastatic human breast cancer cell lines.
CYC1	cancer	Our results indicated that CYC1 plays crucial roles in breast cancer progression and might be a predictive factor assisting future patient diagnosis.
cytochrome c1	renal cell carcinoma	Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase hinge protein (UQCRH), as a connecter between cytochrome c1 with cytochrome c in complex III of respiratory chain, is top-ranked hypermethylated gene in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).
CYC1	glioma	This study aimed at testing a panel of nine reference genes [beta-2-microglobulin, cytochrome c-1 (CYC1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hydroxymethylbilane synthase, hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase 1, ribosomal protein L13a (RPL13A), succinate dehydrogenase, TATA-box binding protein and 14-3-3 protein zeta] to identify and validate the most suitable reference genes for expression studies in human glioma of different grades (World Health Organization grades II-IV).
CYC1	glioma	After analysis of the stability values calculated using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms, GAPDH, RPL13A, and CYC1 can be indicated as reference genes applicable for accurate normalization of gene expression in glioma compared with normal brain and anaplastic astrocytoma or glioblastoma alone within this experimental setting.
TTK	breast cancer	Kaplan-Meier plots identified correlations between individual or combined overexpression of E2F1, E2F3a, Mps1/TTK, Nek2, BubR1, or Hec1 and poor overall and relapse-free survival of breast cancer patients.
TTK	breast cancer	By interrogating the METABRIC database, we observed a significant correlation between p53 expression and that of c-Abl and TTK in basal-like breast cancers.
TTK	breast cancer	The protein kinase threonine tyrosine kinase (TTK; also known as Mps1) is a critical component of the spindle assembly checkpoint and a promising drug target for the treatment of aggressive cancers, such as triple negative breast cancer.
TTK	breast cancer	High levels of the mitotic checkpoint kinase Mps1/TTK have correlated with high histologic grade in breast cancer, suggesting a potential new therapeutic target for aggressive breast cancers (BC).
Mps1	breast cancer	These compounds were evaluated in anti-proliferative assays of a panel of 15 breast cancer cell lines and further examined for their ability to inhibit a variety of Mps1-dependent biological functions.
Mps1	breast cancer	In addition, the lead compounds 1 and 13 inhibit Mps1 kinase enzymatic activity with IC50 values from 0.356myM to 0.809myM, and inhibited Mps1-associated cellular functions such as centrosome duplication and the spindle checkpoint in triple negative breast cancer cells.
TTK	breast cancer	Using drug discovery technologies, computational modeling, medicinal chemistry, cell culture and in vivo assays, novel small molecule Mps1/TTK inhibitors have been identified as potential targeted therapies for breast cancers.
Mps1	breast cancer	However, high levels of Mps1 are found in many types of human malignancies, including glioblastoma, thyroid carcinoma, breast cancer, and other cancers.
TTK	breast cancer	Here, we employed amphiphilic polymers and silenced the expression of two cell cycle proteins, TTK and CDC20, and the anti-apoptosis protein survivin to determine the efficacy of polymer-mediated siRNA treatment in breast cancer cells as well as side effects in nonmalignant cells in vitro.
MMP-1	rheumatic heart disease	To explore expressions of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor-Beta1 (TGF-Beta1) in valve tissue of rheumatic heart disease (RHD), and to analyzed their roles in RHD.
ADAMTS-13	lupus nephritis	Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate plasma ADAMTS-13 activity in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis and to evaluate the role of clinical, laboratory and pathological features, especially the vascular lesions in lupus nephritis.
ADAMTS-13	lupus nephritis	Results Plasma ADAMTS-13 activity in lupus nephritis patients was significantly lower than that in normal controls (84 +/- 21% vs. 90 +/- 13%, p = 0.005).
ADAMTS-13	lupus nephritis	Conclusions Decreased ADAMTS-13 activity was found in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis, and plasma ADAMTS-13 activity was closely associated with renal injury indices, especially pathological vascular scores.
ADAMTS-13	lupus nephritis	The serum ADAMTS-13 activity was significantly lower in patients with both lupus nephritis and TTP-HUS than in patients with lupus nephritis only and in normal control (40% versus 69%, P = 0.012; 40% versus 81%, P &lt; 0.001, respectively).
ADAMTS-13	lupus nephritis	The prevalence of ADAMTS-13 autoantibodies was significantly higher in patients with both lupus nephritis and TTP-HUS than in patients with lupus nephritis only and in normal control (6/7, 86% versus 10/55, 18%, P &lt; 0.001; 6/7, 86% versus 0, P &lt; 0.001, respectively).
ADAMTS-13	lupus nephritis	ADAMTS-13 autoantibodies might play an important role in the pathogenesis of TTP-HUS associated with lupus nephritis.
vWF-CP	lupus nephritis	Plasma vWF and vWF-CP activities were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and residual collagen binding assay respectively in patients with lupus nephritis (n = 31), primary nephritic syndrome (n = 25), diabetic nephropathy (n = 45), chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 38) and 40 normal controls.
vWF-CP	lupus nephritis	Renal biopsy demonstrated that the vWF level in stage IV was higher than in stages II and III while vWF-CP activity was lower in patients with lupus nephritis.
vWF-CP	lupus nephritis	Furthermore the demonstration of a normal vWF-CP assay aided in the distinction between TTP and MAHA due to lupus nephritis.
KLC	Alzheimer's disease	In this study we have investigated the distribution and the level of expression of kinesin light chains (KLCs) (responsible for binding of cargos during anterograde transport) and of dynein intermediate chain (DIC) (a component of the dynein complex during retrograde transport) in frontal cortex and cerebellar cortex of control subjects and Alzheimer's disease patients.
KLC	Alzheimer's disease	By immunoblotting, we found a significant decrease in the levels of expression of KLC1 and 2 and DIC in the frontal cortex, but not in the cerebellar cortex, of Alzheimer's disease patients.
KLC	Alzheimer's disease	We suggest that reduction of KLCs and DIC proteins in AD cortex results from both reduced expression and neuronal loss, and that these reductions and GSK-3Beta-mediated phosphorylation of KLC1 contribute to disturbances of axoplasmic flows and synaptic integrity in Alzheimer's disease.
neb	cystic fibrosis	Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) often have suboptimal adherence rates to nebulized medication.
neb	cystic fibrosis	A cocktail of three phages active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients was developed for a potential nebulized formulation.
neb	cystic fibrosis	Treatment regimen for families of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is considerable, particularly when nebulised therapies for chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection are prescribed.
neb	cystic fibrosis	The time requirements for multiple daily nebulizer treatments are important impediments to the quality of life for most patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
CHRNA7	cleft palate	Therefore, in this study, the author describes for the first time the common feature of oral clefts in patients carrying a microduplication of 15q13.3 encompassing the CHRNA7 gene, which sheds light on the correlation between CHRNA7 and cleft palate.
CHRNA7	cleft palate	In contrast to GTG banding, array CGH determined the exact number of deleted genes and thus allowed the identification of candidate genes for cleft palate (GREM1, CX36, MEIS2), congenital heart defect (ACTC, GREM1, CX36, MEIS2), and mental retardation (ARHGAP11A, CHRNA7, CHRM5).
NFIA	intellectual disability	Comparative deletion mapping shows that this region can be dissected into five chromosomal segments containing at least six candidate genes (DAB1, HOOK1, NFIA, DOCK7, DNAJC6, and PDE4B) most likely responsible for syndromic intellectual disability, which was corroborated by their reduced transcript levels in RT-qPCR.
NFIA	intellectual disability	Importantly, one patient with an intragenic microdeletion within NFIA and an additional patient with a balanced translocation disrupting NFIA display intellectual disability coupled with macrocephaly.
NFIA	intellectual disability	We propose NFIA is responsible for intellectual disability coupled with macrocephaly, and microdeletions at 1p31.3p32.2 constitute a contiguous gene syndrome with several genes contributing to syndromic intellectual disability.
NFIA	mental retardation	Non-progressive cerebellar ataxia with mental retardation (CANPMR, OMIM 614756) and chromosome 1p32-p31 deletion syndrome (OMIM 613735) are two very rare inherited disorders, which are caused by mono-allelic deficiency (haplo-insufficiency) of calmodulin-binding transcription activator 1 (CAMTA1) and, respectively, nuclear factor 1 A (NFIA) genes.
Nfia	autism	Among these 24 genes, four transcription factors Auts2, Nfia, Nr4a2, and Sox5 were found, suggesting that TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis.
NFIA	autism	Some of these maternal and maternal-child associations were in or adjacent to autism candidate genes including: PCDH9, FOXP1, GABRB3, NRXN1, RELN, MACROD2, FHIT, RORA, CNTN4, CNTNAP2, FAM135B, LAMA1, NFIA, NLGN4X, RAPGEF4, and SDK1.
p47 phox	Type 2 diabetes Mellitus	These results provided a mechanistic linking between TRPM2-mediated Ca2+ influx and p47 phox signaling to induce excess ROS production and TXNIP-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation under HG, and suggested that TRPM2 represented a potential target for alleviating NLRP3 inflammasome activation related to hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress in Type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).
SOX3	mental retardation	SOX3 mutations have been associated with growth hormone deficiency, variable degrees of additional pituitary hormone deficiencies, and mental retardation.
SOX3	intellectual disability	SOX3 involvement should be considered in a male with short stature due to GH deficiency associated with intellectual disability.
SOX3	intellectual disability	A further XX male, ascertained because of intellectual disability, carried a de novo cryptic duplication at Xq27.1, involving SOX3.
SOX3	mental retardation	In humans, over- and underdosage of SOX3 is associated with X-linked hypopituitarism with variable phenotypes ranging from isolated GH deficiency (GHD) to panhypopituitarism, with or without mental retardation and, in most cases, with reported pituitary imaging, an ectopic/undescended posterior pituitary.
SOX3	mental retardation	Screening for SOX3 should be advised not only for hypopituitary patients with an ectopic posterior pituitary, but also for those with a structurally normal pituitary and additional findings, including clefts and a persistent craniopharyngeal canal, with or without mental retardation.
SOX3	mental retardation	Both duplications encompassing SOX3 and loss-of function mutations in SOX3 have been reported in a minor portion of X-linked isolated growth hormone deficiency (GHD) or combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD) patients with or without mental retardation.
SOX3	intellectual disability	In humans, duplication of SOX3 and polyalanine expansions at its C-terminus may cause intellectual disability and hypopituitarism.
sox3	mental retardation	The UNH159 marker as well as RNA-binding motif protein, X-linked (rbmx), SRY-box containing gene 3 (sox3) and alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (atrx) genes were mapped to linkage group 2.
SOX3	mental retardation	Both overdosage of SOX3, as a result of gene duplication, and loss of function resulting from expansion of the first polyalanine (PA) tract are associated with variable degrees of hypopituitarism, with or without mental retardation.
SOX3	mental retardation	Duplications and polyalanine expansions within the transcription factor SOX3 have recently been described in association with infundibular hypoplasia, hypopituitarism and variable mental retardation, whilst mutations in SOX2 are associated with variable hypopituitarism in association with learning difficulties, oesophageal atresia and anophthalmia.
CCTdelta	embryonal carcinoma	Using mouse P19 embryonal carcinoma cells, which divide rapidly, yet in retinoic acid adopt a neuronal phenotype, admixed with occasional (approximately 10%) fibroblast-like cells, together with a panel of peptide-specific antibodies raised to 7 of the 8 CCT subunits we show that; (1) adoption of a post mitotic phenotype is accompanied by reduced CCT protein expression, significantly more so for CCTbeta, CCTdelta, CCTepsilon, and CCTtheta than for CCTalpha (TCP-1), CCTgamma and CCTzeta; (2) CCTalpha is detected preferentially over other subunits in neurites of P19 neurons; (3) small amounts of CCTalpha and gamma are localised in nuclei (i.e.
SIRT2	pneumonia	In line with these observations, in preclinical models, SIRT2 deficiency increases survival of mice with chronic staphylococcal infection, while having no effect on the course of toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, LPS or TNF-induced shock, fulminant Escherichia coli peritonitis, sub-lethal Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia, and chronic candidiasis.
sirtuin	pulmonary edema	Lung injury was studied by measuring: vascular permeability-related pulmonary edema; histopathologic scores, neutrophil infiltration and concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar fluid; expression of inflammatory enzymes and sirtuin (SIRT) 1 as well as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-KB) activity in pulmonary tissues.
sirtuin	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	The aim of our study was to compare the expression of sirtuin in large and small airways in nonsmokers, asymptomatic smokers, and smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
sirtuin	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	Smokers both with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had decreased sirtuin expression in large airways.
sirtuin	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	However, in small airways, sirtuin expression was decreased only in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
sirtuin	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	Smoking is characterized by suppressed sirtuin expression in large airways, whereas chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by more severe suppression of sirtuin expression both in large and small airways.
SLC29A2	colorectal cancer	Human equilibrative nucleoside transporters (hENT) 1 and 2, encoded by SLC29A1 and SLC29A2, permit the bidirectional passage of nucleoside analogues into cells and may correlate with clinical responses to chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).
SLC29A2	cancer	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression profiles of SLC29A1 and SLC29A2 in human cancer cell lines.
SLC29A2	cancer	Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we comprehensively profiled the transcription levels of SLC29A1 and SLC29A2 in 16 colon cancer cell lines.
SLC29A2	cancer	We validated the ubiquitous and heterogeneous distribution of SLC29A1 and SLC29A2 in human colon cancer cell lines and demonstrated that SLC29A1 was highly expressed in 25% of metastatic cell lines (Colo201 and Colo205) and 62.5% of primary cell lines (Caco2, Colo320, HCT116, RKO, and SW48).
SLC29A2	cancer	For the first time, we showed that both SLC29A1 and SLC29A2 were expressed at lower levels in colon cancer cell lines originating from metastatic sites than from primary sites.
ENT2	cancer	As ENT inhibitors including dilazep have shown efficacy improving oHSV1 targeted oncolytic cancer therapy, a series of dilazep analogues was synthesized and biologically evaluated to examine both ENT1 and ENT2 inhibition.
INHA	HLHS	The most significant changes common to HLHS-RV versus control-RV and control-LV sample groups is observed for Anti mullerian hormone receptor 2 (AMHR2) (+18.79 control-RV, +3.38 control-LV), and the BMP antagonist Inhibin alpha (INHA) (+11.47 control-RV, +5.73 control-LV).
ETV5	endometrioid carcinoma	We have described previously the Ets family member ERM/ETV5 specifically upregulated in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma (EEC) associated with myometrial infiltration.
ETV5	endometrial carcinoma	We have described recently the Ets family transcription factor, ERM/ETV5, specifically up-regulated in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC) and associated with myometrial infiltration.
ETV5	endometrial carcinoma	Finally, the specific localization of ERM/ETV5 and MMP-2 at the invasive front of myometrial infiltrating human endometrial carcinomas further reinforced the hypothesis of a role for ERM/ETV5 in the early steps of endometrial dissemination.
Gfi1	lymphoid leukemia	Most importantly, the defects seen in Gfi1 deficient mice also point to roles of Gfi1 in diseases of the immune system that involve auto-immune responses and acute lymphoid leukemia and lymphoma.
gfi-1	lymphoid leukemia	The results showed that the gfi-1 expression level in all leukemia patients was significantly higher than that in normal group (p &lt; 0.05); the gfi-1 mRNA expression in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) patients was significantly higher than that in normal group (p &lt; 0.05); but the difference of gfi-1 mRNA expression between AL and CML or ALL and AML was not significant.
MDM2	dermatitis	The MDM2 309GG genotype was linked to a higher risk of acute G3-4 dermatitis.
MDM2	dermatitis	In an antibody microarray chip analysis, MDM2 expression was increased in atopic dermatitis patients.
LRP5	cancer	All doxorubicin (Dox)-resistant tumors expressed higher levels of cancer stem-like cell biomarkers, including CD44, Wnt and its receptor LRP5/6, relative to Dox-sensitive tumors.
LRP5	cancer	Our results showed that simultaneous binding to LRP5/6 and uPAR by the dual receptor targeted IONPs was required to inhibit breast cancer cell invasion.
STAT5	hyperinsulinemia	STAT5 LKO caused hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia and elevated free fatty acid and cholesterol concentrations under HFD feeding but induced only hyperglycemia on normal diet.
Prx2	Beta-thalassemia	Prx2 is a key cytoprotector against IO that is induced either by iron supplementation or due to chronic hemolysis as in Beta-thalassemia.
Peroxiredoxin-2	thalassemia	Peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2), a typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin, is upregulated during Beta-thalassemic erythropoiesis, but its contribution to stress erythropoiesis, a common feature of thalassemia, is yet to be fully defined.
peroxiredoxin 2	thalassemia	In the present study, we aimed to investigate plasma levels of peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) and thioredoxin 1 (Trx1), and the activity of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), in thalassemia major (TM) patients living in the Antalya region, Turkey.
peroxiredoxin 2	thalassemia	Proteomic analysis of microparticles released from thalassemia intermedia erythrocytes indicated that, besides hemichromes and clustered band 3, the microparticles contain a characteristic set of proteins that includes catalase, heat shock protein 70, peroxiredoxin 2 and carbonic anhydrase.
Prx II	thalassemia	Interestingly, Prx II interacted with Hb in mouse RBCs, and their interaction, in particular, was severely impaired in RBCs of patients with thalassemia (THAL) and sickle cell anemia (SCA).
FIBP	intellectual disability	The cover image, by Lihadh Al Gazali et al., is based on the Original Article A recessive syndrome of intellectual disability, moderate overgrowth, and renal dysplasia predisposing to Wilms tumor is caused by a mutation in FIBP gene, DOI:10.1002/ajmg.a.37741.
ANGPTL2	kidney disease	Different observational clinical studies reported that circulating levels of ANGPTL2 increase significantly in various chronic inflammatory diseases and showed associations between ANGPTL2 levels and diagnosis and/or prognosis of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and various types of cancers.
ANGPTL2	CKD	Circulating ANGPTL2 is increased in chronic kidney disease (CKD), where the risk of CVD is amplified.
ANGPTL2	CKD	The positive association between post-KTx ANGPTL2, aortic stiffness and mortality, suggests that ANGPTL2 may play a biological role in CKD-related CVD.
ANGPTL2	renal fibrosis	Histological analysis of human kidneys indicated abundant expression of angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2) in renal tubule epithelial cells during progression of renal fibrosis.
ANGPTL2	renal fibrosis	Furthermore, ANGPTL2 deficiency in a mouse unilateral ureteral obstruction model significantly reduced renal fibrosis by decreasing TGF-Beta1 signal amplification in kidney.
ANGPTL2	renal fibrosis	Thus, ANGPTL2 and TGF-Beta1 positively regulate each other as renal fibrosis progresses.
ANGPTL2	ureteral obstruction	demonstrated that genetic depletion of Angptl2 confers amelioration of the mouse kidney fibrosis induced by a unilateral ureteral obstruction, implicating that ANGPTL2, predominantly in the renal tubular compartments, activates the transforming growth factor-Beta signaling and vice versa through miR-221.
ANGPTL2	mastitis	In the present study, we tested whether there is a correlation between increased ANGPTL2 expression and inflammation in response to Staphylococcus aureus in murine mastitis and the mechanisms involved.
ANGPTL2	mastitis	The present findings indicate ANGPTL2 may mediate the inflammation in murine mastitis through the activation of IL-6 and TNF-Alfa.
Angptl2	CKD	The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum Angptl2 level and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Angptl2	CKD	The age- and sex-adjusted ORs for the presence of CKD increased with higher serum Angptl2 level.
Angptl2	CKD	Elevated serum Angptl2 is associated with the likelihood of CKD in the general population.
Angptl2	nephropathy	We investigated whether serum Angptl2 levels are associated with diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Angptl2	nephropathy	This suggests a possible role of Angptl2 in progressive nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.
myophosphorylase	hyperkalemic periodic paralysis	Improvements to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based genotyping assays currently used for detection of mutations responsible for bovine ferrochelatase and myophosphorylase deficiencies, and equine hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) are described.
TOAG-1	psoriasis	Thus, peripheral changes of TOAG-1 and RHAMM expression can be used to predict clinical response to Alefacept treatment in psoriasis patients.
PARP	cerebral infarct	In this study, we examined the pharmacological profile of KCL-440, a new PARP inhibitor, and its neuroprotective effects in the rat acute cerebral infarction model induced by photothrombotic middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion.
PARP	cerebral infarct	Our data thus suggest that the tested PARP polymorphisms do not principally contribute to cerebral infarction, although extensive searches would be required to clarify whether the PARP gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of human stroke.
SUB1	breast cancer	The OR of breast cancer for the percentage BPE measure (BPE%) quantified from SUB1 was 3.5 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.3, 9.8; p = 0.015) for 20% increments.
SUB1	prostate cancer	In this study, we show elevated expression of SUB1 in aggressive prostate cancer.
SUB1	prostate cancer	Knockdown of SUB1 in prostate cancer cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro, and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.
SUB1	prostate cancer	PLK1 knockdown or use of PLK1 inhibitor can mitigate oncogenic function of SUB1 in benign prostate cancer cells.
SUB1	prostate cancer	Thus, our study suggests that miR-101 loss results in increased SUB1 expression and subsequent activation of known oncogenes driving prostate cancer progression and metastasis.
SUB1	prostate cancer	This study therefore demonstrates functional role of SUB1 in prostate cancer, and identifies its regulation and potential downstream therapeutic targets of SUB1 in prostate cancer.
PC4	lung adenocarcinoma	The proposed study aims to explore whether PC4 correlates with VEGF-C/VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 axis of lymphangiogenesis in the lymph node metastasis during lung adenocarcinoma.
PC4	lung adenocarcinoma	Here, small interfering RNA technique was employed to investigate the relationship of PC4 and the VEGF-C/VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 axis in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines as well as tumor xenografts of mice model.
PC4	lung adenocarcinoma	PC4 expression correlated with the levels of VEGF-C, VEGF-D and VEGFR-3 during the development of lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma in vitro and in vivo, which may be a novel marker in the development of lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis of tumors.

BIC	CKD	Histomorphometrical analysis of experimental implants inserted in the femurs of CKD mice revealed a trend of decreased BIC ratio at 2-week healing.
bic	end-stage renal disease	A Cochrane Collaboration review (Roderick, Cochrane Data base of systemic reviews 2007, DOI 10.1002/14651858.CD0018.90.pub3) reported that there was no evidence for correction of acidosis by sodium bicarbonate in pre-end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, and concluded that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are necessary to evaluate the benefits and harms of correcting metabolic acidosis in pre-ESRD patients.
Bic	CKD	We will randomize 600 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3b and 4; 300 of these patients will be included in the bicarbonate study group (Bic), in which levels of bicarbonate should be kept &gt;24 mEq/L; the other 300 patients will be included in the usual-treatment group (no-Bic).
Bic	CKD	Acid-Base Disorders in CKD: Moderate metabolic acidosis (Bic 16-20) mEq/L is common with glomerular filtration rates below 20 ml/min, and favors bone demineralization due to the release of calcium and phosphate from the bone, chronic hyperventilation, and muscular weakness and atrophy.
Bic	renal failure	In a prospective randomized crossover trial, patients with acute renal failure received CRRT with either sodium bicarbonate (Bic) or sodium lactate (Lac) as a buffering agent over 2 consecutive 24-h periods.
BIC	renal failure	The combination of bicarbonate and mannitol (BIC/MAN) is commonly used to prevent renal failure (RF) in patients with rhabdomyolysis despite the absence of sufficient evidence validating its use.

Bic	renal failure	Bicarbonate-buffered replacement fluid (RF-bic) in continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) may be superior to lactate-buffered replacement fluid (RF-lac) in acute renal failure.
bic	renal failure	In an open, randomized, multicenter study, we investigated the effects of RF-bic and RF-lac on cardiovascular outcome in patients requiring CVVH following acute renal failure.
bic	renal failure	The data also suggest that the use of RF-bic during CVVH reduces cardiovascular events in critically ill patients with acute renal failure, particularly those with previous cardiovascular disease or heart failure.
BIC	CRF	The effect of BIC on whisker-evoked responses was a preferential enhancement in the responses elicited by the whisker giving rise to the highest probability response (center receptive field whisker or CRF).
BIC	CRF	The primary influence of BIC and, to a lesser degree, 2-OH-S was to prolong the response duration of VPM neurons to CRF whisker stimulation.

bradykinin	nephrosis	THE ROLE OF ANGIOTENSIN-CONVERTING ENZYME INHIBITORS: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) affect the different mechanisms that lead to glomerulosclerosis: antihypertensive effect, with the normalisation of blood pressure having demonstrated its determining role in the production of nephrosis in various epidemiological studies; hemodynamic effect with a decrease in glomerular capillary pressure, in the filtration fraction, and inhibition of the bradykinin deterioration; antiproteinuric effect superior to that of other anti-hypertensive drugs (excepting angiotensin II-receptor antagonists).
bradykinin	nephrosis	To investigate whether the reduction in proteinuria is due to decreased generation of angiotensin II (AngII) or to decreased degradation of bradykinin, four series of experiments in established adriamycin nephrosis were performed.
kininogen	nephrotic syndrome	There were few reports demonstrating behavior of kinin and kininogen in the nephrotic syndrome.
high molecular weight kininogen	nephrotic syndrome	In this paper, coagulation factors related to contact activation, such as factor XII (FXII), factor XI (FXI), prekallikrein (PK), high molecular weight kininogen (HMWKG), and kinins were measured in 15 cases of nephrotic syndrome, and clinical significance of these results were discussed.
kininogen	nephrotic syndrome	It was concluded that kinin formation in the nephrotic syndrome was not due to the activation of intrinsic coagulation system but due to release of kinin from low molecular weight kininogen.

PROs	ovarian cancer	Despite the support for including patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and health-related quality of life in clinical trials, there have been deficiencies in how these have been assessed and reported in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) clinical trials.
PROs	Ovarian Cancer	To redress this, the 5th Ovarian Cancer Consensus Conference, included a plenary session entitled 'How to include PROs in clinical trials'.
PROs	ovarian cancer	To test the hypothesis that ovarian cancer patients with worse PROs would drop out earlier, we examined how patients differed by time of dropout on health-related quality of life (HRQOL), anxiety, depression, optimism and insomnia.
PROs	ovarian cancer	Progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were significantly improved by adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) in the phase III AURELIA trial.
PROs	ovarian cancer	Despite increased recognition of the value of including patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as important end points in phase III clinical trials, there has been a lack of pre-specified PRO hypotheses and shortcomings with the analyses and interpretation of PROs in many ovarian cancer trials.
PROs	ovarian cancer	Promoting the importance of hypothesis-driven PROs in ovarian cancer clinical trials will lead to improvements in the design of these trials and the interpretation of their results.
PROs	ovarian cancer	We conducted the Surgery in Ovarian Cancer Quality of life Evaluation Research study (SOCQER 1), a prospective study investigating the feasibility of collection of serial PROs in patients who had extensive surgery and standard surgery for ovarian cancer.
PROs	ovarian cancer	There is no consensus as to what symptoms or quality-of-life (QOL) domains should be measured as patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in ovarian cancer clinical trials.
PROs	ovarian cancer	The results were included in and combined with an expert consensus-building process to identify the most salient PROs for ovarian cancer clinical trials.
PROs	ovarian cancer	We identified a set of PROs specific to ovarian cancer: abdominal pain, bloating, cramping, fear of recurrence/disease progression, indigestion, sexual dysfunction, vomiting, weight gain, and weight loss.
PROs	ovarian cancer	Findings of the review and consensus process provide good support for use of these ovarian cancer-specific PROs in ovarian cancer clinical trials.

ICCA syndrome	FHM	To characterise the phenotype of a family with paroxysmal exercise induced dystonia (PED) and migraine and establish whether it is linked to the paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) locus on chromosome 2q33-35, the familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) locus on chromosome 19p, or the familial infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis (ICCA syndrome) locus on chromosome 16.
ICCA	FHM	Haplotypes were reconstructed for all the available family members by typing several microsatellite markers spanning the PNKD, FHM, and ICCA loci.
ICCA	FHM	Linkage of the disease to the PNKD, FHM, or ICCA loci was excluded as no common haplotype was shared by all the affected members for each locus.
ICCA	FHM	This family presented with the classic phenotype of PED and is not linked to the PNKD, FHM, or ICCA loci.

CHC1L	myeloma	RAN, ZHX2 and RCBTB2 (CHC1L) expression was evaluated by quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in plasma cells from 85 monoclonal gammopathies: 58 symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) (52 untreated, six relapsed), eight smouldering MM, five monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, four plasma cell leukaemias and 10 myeloid cell lines.
BCCIP	microcephaly	BCCIP deficiency impaired embryonic and postnatal neural development, causing severe ataxia, cerebral and cerebellar defects, and microcephaly.
Lck	HS1	Phosphorylation also links HS1 to multiple signaling proteins, including Lck, PLCgamma1, and Vav1, and is essential for the stable recruitment of Vav1 to the IS.
Lck	HS1	On the other hand, we confirmed previously mapped Lck SH3 binding sites in ADAM15, HS1, SLP76, and NS5A, and identified putative Lck SH3 binding sites of Sam68, FasL, c-Cbl, and Cbl-b.
lck	HS1	The SH2 domains of ZAP70, SHP-1 and PLC gamma 1 and the SH3 domains of lck, vav and HS1 did not bind to pp85--90.
Lck	HS-1	These analyses identified several cellular proteins inside HIV-1: elongation factor 1alpha, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, HS-1, phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein, Pin1, Lck, Nm23-H1, and the C-terminal tail of CD43.
Lck	HS1	We find that the Src homology 3 domains of Grb2 directly associate, in vitro and in vivo, with murine hemopoietic specific protein 1 (HS1), a protein identical to Lck-binding protein 1.
Lck	HS1	Because HS1 associates with the p56(lck) and p59(lyn) tyrosine kinases in vitro and in vivo, and becomes tyrosine phosphorylated upon various receptor stimulations, our present data suggest that HS1 mediates linkage between Lck or Lyn and Grb2 in lymphoid lineage cells.
Lck	HS1	With this method, we previously isolated an Lck tyrosine kinase-associated protein, LckBP1, which is identical to HS1 (Kitamura et al., 1989, 1995; Takemoto et al., 1995).
PURalpha	prostate cancer	We have previously found that purine-rich element binding protein, PURalpha, was significantly repressed in androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines in comparison to an androgen-dependent line.
PURalpha	prostate cancer	Moreover, over-expressing PURalpha in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells attenuated their cell proliferation.
PURalpha	prostate cancer	These findings suggest that regulation of PURalpha expression in prostate cancer cells may serve as a therapeutic target for hormone refractory prostate cancer.
PURA	cancer	We investigated the effects of the DNA damage-inducing cancer chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin on mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from PURA(-/-) knockout mice that lack Puralpha.

Keratinocyte growth factor	gingival overgrowth	Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and scatter factor (SF) are fibroblast-derived growth factors with potent mitogenic and motogenic effects on epithelial cells, and, therefore, could be involved in the pathogenesis of gingival overgrowth.
KGF	gingival overgrowth	These results suggest that KGF and SF may have an important role in cyclosporin-induced gingival overgrowth.
herd 2	hydranencephaly	On return to the district to calve, 54% of calves from herd 1 and 30% of calves from herd 2 were affected with congenital arthrogryposis or hydranencephaly caused by Akabane virus infection.
USP6	cherubism	Twelve patients with classic radiologic and histologic features of MO, 6 with brown tumors, and 5 with cherubism diagnosed at our institution were studied for the presence of USP6 rearrangements using fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes flanking the USP6 locus on chromosome 17p13.
USP6	cherubism	None of the patients with brown tumor or cherubism demonstrated USP6 rearrangements.
USP6	cherubism	In contrast, no USP6 rearrangements were found in patients with cherubism or brown tumor, supporting the prevailing view that these lesions are distinct biologic entities.
RanGAP	Huntington's disease	Consistent with findings in mice, marked alterations in nuclear envelope morphology, abnormal localization of RanGAP1, and nuclear accumulation of mRNA were found in cortex of Huntington's disease patients.
RanGap1	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	Double immunofluorescent analyses revealed nuclear retention and apparent colocalization of RanGap1 with Nup205, Gp210 with Nup205, and partial colocalization of Nup205 with Nup107; most of the ischemic changes above were similar to those observed in patients with C9orf72-genetic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
RanGAP	cancer	Detection of the expression of these proteins and genes encoding these proteins in human gastric cancer tissues by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot revealed that the expression of Beta-ACTIN, LDH, DLD, PRPF19 and CaM genes were up-regulated and RanGAP was down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and/or metastatic lymph nodes compared to peri-cancerous tissues.
CYP2C	coronary artery disease	Stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) patients scheduled for PCI were randomized to one of the three study arms: 1) genotyping, 2) PFT, and 3) control and evaluated by the CYP2C19 allele genotyping and PFT with P2Y12 assay.
CYP2C	coronary heart disease	To assess the association of CYP2C19 G681A, P2RY12 H1/H2, and ITGB3 T1565C polymorphisms with the extent of platelet aggregation in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) during antiplatelet therapy.
cleavage stimulation factor subunit 2	cancer	This shortening of the HuR mRNA 3'-UTR via alternative polyadenylation (APA) was observed to be dependent on cleavage stimulation factor subunit 2 (CSTF2/CstF-64), which is up-regulated in the TAMR breast cancer cells.
CSTF2	cancer	Moreover, CSTF2, POLA1, HMOX2, and EFNB2 may be associated with the prognosis of bladder cancer patient.
CSTF2	cancer	Accordingly, RNAi-induced silencing of CSTF2 decreased the proliferative rate of cancer cells.
CSTF2	cancer	Immunohistochemical staining using tissue microarray consisting of 327 lung cancers was applied to examine the expression of CSTF2 protein and its prognostic value.
CSTF2	cancer	A role of CSTF2 in cancer cell growth was examined by siRNA experiments.
CSTF2	cancer	Immunohistochemical analysis using tissue microarray showed an association of strong CSTF2 expression with poor prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (P = 0.0079), and multivariate analysis showed that CSTF2 positivity is an independent prognostic factor.
CSTF2	cancer	In addition, suppression of CSTF2 expression by siRNAs suppressed lung cancer cell growth, whereas exogenous expression of CSTF2 promoted growth and invasion of mammalian cells.
CD68	mammary tumor	Immunohistochemistry analysis of cellular immune parameters (CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, CIITA, MHC-II and CD68) was performed on NMU-induced rat mammary tumor nodules, followed by evaluation of the serum level of 34 cytokines using the cytokine antibody array.
CD68	breast cancer	Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine PD-L1 tumor cell expression and to enumerate CD8, CD4 and CD68 tumor-infiltrating leucocytes (TIL) in a cohort of 443 breast cancers categorized by molecular subtype.
CD68	breast tumor	These findings demonstrate, for the first time, a novel capacity of a P-Alexa647-FA conjugate to colocalize to CD11b+CD68+ TAMs in both primary and metastatic breast tumors.
CD68	breast tumor	We used breast tumor tissues from each patient to make tissue microarrays that were then stained for leukocyte and myeloid markers including CD4, CD8, CD20, CD25, CD68, and CD163 using immunohistochemical techniques.
CD68	ovarian cancer	Furthermore, high density of CD163+ and CD68+ TAMs was observed in ovarian cancer with advanced TNM stage.
CD68	breast cancer	The number of CD68+CD163+ M2-like macrophages was significantly higher in breast cancer tissues than in benign tissues.
CLCN2	leukodystrophy	Characterisation of most mutations found in CLCN2 in patients with CC2L leukodystrophy show that they cause a reduction in function of the chloride channel ClC-2.
ClC-2	leukodystrophy	GlialCAM, a regulatory subunit of ClC-2 in glial cells and involved in the leukodystrophy megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC), increases the activity of a ClC-2 mutant by affecting ClC-2 gating and by stabilising the mutant at the plasma membrane.
CLCN2	leukodystrophy	We suggest that leukodystrophy-causing CLCN2 mutations reduce the functional expression of ClC-2, which is partly counteracted by GlialCAM/MLC1-mediated increase in the gating and stability of the channel.
ClC-2	epilepsy	The review then discusses the diseases associated with ClC-2, including degeneration of the retina, Sjoegren's syndrome, age-related cataracts, degeneration of the testes, azoospermia, lung cancer, constipation, repair of impaired intestinal mucosa barrier, leukemia, cystic fibrosis, leukoencephalopathy, epilepsy and diabetes mellitus.
CLCN2	epilepsy	A subset of these genes has been implicated in other neurobehavioral disorders including depression (SLIT3), epilepsy (CLCN2, PRICKLE1), intellectual disability (AP4M1), schizophrenia (WDR60), and Tourette syndrome (OFCC1).
EGMA	epilepsy	Epilepsy with grand mal on awakening (EGMA) is a well-defined subtype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.
SNAI3	melanoma	Additionally, using global gene expression analysis of partially reprogrammed cells, we identified SNAI3 as a novel invasion-related marker in human melanoma.
SNAI3	melanoma	SNAI3 expression correlates with tumor thickness in primary melanomas and thus, may be of prognostic value.
SNAI3	thyroid carcinoma	Effective silencing of Runx2 by short interfering RNA (siRNA) demonstrated downregulation of EMT-related molecules (SNAI2, SNAI3 and TWIST1), MMP2 and vasculogenic factors (VEGFA and VEGFC) in thyroid carcinoma cells.
TPO1	goiter	Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, goiter and thyroid dysfunction were higher in children who were anti-TPO1 than in diabetic children without thyroid autoimmunity.
HS-40	thalassemia	Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) can be used to detect rearrangements that cause Alfa-thalassemia, particularly large deletions involving the whole Alfa cluster and/or deletions in the HS-40 region.
HS-40	Hb H	In addition to the -Alfa3.7 deletion identified in the patients with Hb H disease, four different Alfa0 deletions removing 15 to 225 kb DNA segments were found: two of them remove both the Alfa genes, one affects only the regulatory element (HS-40) region, and another one extends over the entire Alfa cluster and the HS-40 region.
MARE	anemia	The impact of urinary VDBP and KIM-1 on MARE was independent of known CIN risk factors such as anemia, preexisting renal failure, preexisting heart failure, and diabetes.
MARE	HS2	The data show that a tandem Maf recognition element (MARE) in locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive site 2 (HS2) reveals a remarkably high degree of occupancy during differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells.
MARE	HS2	Targeting of an artificial zinc finger DNA-binding domain (ZF-DBD) to the HS2 tandem MARE caused a reduction in the association of MARE-binding proteins and transcription complexes at LCR HS2 and the adult Betamajor-globin gene promoter but did not affect expression of the Betaminor-globin gene.
MARE	HS2	The data demonstrate that a stable MARE-associated footprint in LCR HS2 is important for the recruitment of transcription complexes to the adult Betamajor-globin gene promoter during erythroid cell differentiation.
CD172a	mLNs	Next, we demonstrate that CD172a(+)Slan DCs that produced IL-1Beta and TNF-Alfa accumulated in mLNs and colons of CD patients.
CD172a	mLNs	In conclusion, we propose that proinflammatory CD14(bright)CD172a(+)Slan DCs are a distinguishing feature between CD and UC, as these cells accumulate uniquely in mLNs and colonic mucosa of CD patients.
CD172a	mLNs	Here, we show that CD172a(+)CD11c(+) cells accumulate in the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) and inflamed intestinal mucosa in patients with Crohn's disease (CD).
CD172a	mLNs	An avidity-improved CD47 fusion protein (CD47-Var1) suppresses the release of a wide array of inflammatory cytokines by CD172a(+) cells, which may include HLA-DR(-)CD172a(+) neutrophils, in inflamed colonic explant cultures and impairs the ability of HLA-DR(+)CD172a(+) cells to activate memory Th17 but not Th1 responses in mLNs.
SIRP	mLNs	We first show that mucosal CD103(-) DCs selectively express SIRPalpha and that their frequency was augmented in the lamina propria and mLNs of mice that developed Th17-biased colitis in response to trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid.
SIRP	mLNs	CD47 expression was required on the SIRPalpha(+)CD103(-) DCs for efficient trafficking to mLNs in vivo, whereas it was dispensable on both DCs and T cells for Th17 polarization in vitro.
calmodulin	growth hormone-producing pituitary tumor	Effects of Ca2+ and calmodulin on the adenylate cyclase activity of a prolactin and growth hormone-producing pituitary tumor cell strain (GH3) were examined.
PTG	secondary hyperparathyroidism	The control of PTG hyperplasia is most important in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), because the advanced stage of hyperplasia is considered irreversible.
PTG	secondary hyperparathyroidism	Control of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) using active vitamin D analogues becomes difficult in advanced SHPT, because the enlarged parathyroid glands (PTGs) are resistant to medical therapy.
PTG	secondary hyperparathyroidism	The long-term effect of cinacalcet hydrochloride treatment on parathyroid gland (PTG) volume has been scarcely investigated in patients with moderate to advanced secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT).
miR-9	arthritis	It has been suggested that microRNA-9 (miR-9) is associated with the development of knee osteoarthritis (OA).
ARHR	hypophosphatemia	X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), autosomal dominant HR (ADHR), and autosomal recessive HR (ARHR) are examples of hereditary forms of HR, which are mainly caused by mutations in the phosphate regulating endopeptidase homolog, X-linked (PHEX), FGF23, and, dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1) and ecto-nucleotide pyro phosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) genes, respectively.
ARHP	hypophosphatemia	Homozygous inactivating mutations in DMP1 (dentin matrix protein 1), the gene encoding a noncollagenous bone matrix protein expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes, cause autosomal recessive hypophosphatemia (ARHP).
ARHP	hypophosphatemia	An autosomal recessive form of hypophosphatemia (ARHP) was recently shown to be caused by homozygous mutations in DMP1, the gene encoding dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP-1), a non-collagenous bone matrix protein with an important role in the development and mineralization of bone and teeth.
ARHP	hypophosphatemia	Among various causes of low serum phosphorous are inherited disorders associated with increased urinary excretion of phosphate, including autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), autosomal recessive hypophosphatemia (ARHP), and hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH).
DMP1	hypophosphatemia	Recently, positional cloning approaches furthermore led to the identification of homozygous inactivating mutations in dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) as the cause of an autosomal recessive form of hypophosphatemia.
Cdk5	down disease	Pharmacological treatment of SOD1(G37R) mice with minocycline, a compound that attenuates microgliosis and slows down disease, lessened the dysregulation of Cdk5/Cdk4 and the phosphorylation of Rb.
caspase-1	sarcoma	Seventeen molecules, including transcription factor E2F, T-cell-specific transcription factor, Src (known as "proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase of sarcoma"), interferon regulatory factor 1, thymidylate synthase, cyclin B, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4, CDK, caspase-1, vitamin D receptor, histone deacetylase, MAPK/ERK kinase, bcl-2-associated X protein, runt-related transcription factor 1, PR domain zinc finger protein 1, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and interleukin 1, were identified as candidate molecules.
caspase-1	cancer	Therefore, targeting the caspase-1/PPARGamma/MCAD pathway might be a promising therapeutic approach to prevent tumor progression.Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) promote cancer progression.
caspase-1	cancer	Here, the author show that caspase-1 promotes TAMs differentiation by attenuating medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity and that inhibition of this axis results in suppression of tumour growth in a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer.
Rictor	ureteral obstruction	Ensuing western blotting or immunostaining results showed that Rictor/mTORC2 signaling was activated in kidney interstitial myofibroblasts from mice with unilateral ureteral obstruction.
Rictor	ureteral obstruction	Compared with control littermates, the kidneys of Rictor knockout mice developed less interstitial extracellular matrix deposition and inflammatory cell infiltration at 1 or 2 weeks after ureteral obstruction.
TG-C	synovitis	Less progression of Hoffa-synovitis and effusion-synovitis was observed in the TG-C group compared to placebo (9.6% vs. 21.1%, adjusted RR 0.5, 95%CI [0.2,1.2], p = 0.115).
TG-C	synovitis	Intraarticular treatment with TG-C showed fewer patients in the treated group with progression in structural OA features and other MRI-defined inflammatory markers such as Hoffa-synovitis and effusion-synovitis.
transglutaminase 2	Fibromyalgia	A total of 104 patients (89.4% females) fulfilling the 1990 ACR criteria for FMS and the Rome III criteria for IBS classification and 125 unrelated age- and sex-matched IBS patients without FMS underwent the following studies: haematological, coagulation and biochemistry tests, serological and genetic markers for CD (i.e., tissue transglutaminase 2 (tTG-2) and major histocompatibility complex HLA-DQ2/HLA-DQ8), multiple gastric and duodenal biopsies, FMS tender points (TPs), Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Visual Analogue Scales (VASs) for tiredness and gastrointestinal complaints.
tissue-Trans-Glutaminase	Fibromyalgia	GFD effectiveness was assessed at baseline and after 1 year, examining the score changes in the Tender Points (TPs) test, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for gastrointestinal complaints, pain and tiredness, drug prescriptions and tissue-Trans-Glutaminase (tTG) serum levels.
tissue transglutaminase	myositis	Non-organ specific AAb (ANA, anti-Ro52, anti-Ro60, anti-La, anti-RNP) but not anti-thyroid peroxidase, anti-tissue transglutaminase or myositis-specific antibodies, were more frequent in s-IBM patients, and 14/51 (27%) had another autoimmune disease (Sjoegren's syndrome, thyroiditis, psoriasis, vitiligo).
CD146	glaucoma	By applying CD146 and CD105 antibodies on human retinas from glaucomatous eyes, CD146-positive retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were found, some being placed in perivascular positions; ongoing processes of neurites extension were related to these neurons.
CD146	glaucoma	These results support the hypothesis that in glaucoma eyes the CD146-positive RGCs result from regenerative processes driven by stem cells in the retinal perivascular niches.
CD146	LCA	CD146/MCAM and CD166/ALCAM, previously unreported in cells from fvERMs, were also expressed.
melanoma cell adhesion molecule	microphthalmia	Two new and potentially promising melanocytic markers, microphthalmia transcription factor (MiTF) and melanoma cell adhesion molecule (Mel-CAM), have been shown to be sensitive markers of epithelioid melanoma, but have not been tested in desmoplastic/spindle cell melanoma or in other rare melanocytic neuroectodermal tumors such as clear cell sarcoma.
A1M	diabetes	We investigated the effect of carnosine as an adjuvant therapy on urinary albumin excretion (UAE), the tubular damage marker alpha 1-microglobulin (A1M), and oxidative stress in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes and nephropathy.
A1M	diabetes	The following parameters were measured in 377 patients with type 2 diabetes: HbA1c, serum concentrations of 1,5-AG, GA and creatinine, hemoglobin, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, and urinary excretion of Alfa1 -microglobulin (A1M).
proton-pump	ARDs	Vonoprazan Fumarate (TAK-438F) is a new and effective drug approved in Japan in 2014 for treatment and prevention of acid-related diseases (ARDs), which exhibits many advantages compared with traditional proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs).
proton pump	ARDs	In many countries, the introduction of generic proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) onto the pharmaceutical market increased the phenomenon of therapeutic substitution in acid-related disorders (ARDs).
ANO3	dystonia	We present confirmatory evidence for a role of dystonia genes that had not yet been unequivocally established including PRKRA, TUBB4A, ANO3, and TAF1.
DYT24	Dystonia-24	ANO3 encodes anoctamin-3, a Ca+2-dependent phospholipid scramblase expressed in striatal-neurons, that has been implicated in autosomal dominant craniocervical dystonia (Dystonia-24, DYT24, MIM# 615034).
ANO3	generalized dystonia	Three genes (GCH1, THAP1, TOR1A) were associated with isolated generalized dystonia, whereas 2 (ANO3, ADCY5) gave rise to combined dystonia-myoclonus phenotypes.
ANO3	dystonia	Furthermore, it provides confirmatory evidence for a dystonia-relevant role of ANO3 and ADCY5, both of which likely associate with a broader spectrum of dystonic expressions than previously thought.
DYT24	dystonia	In the past 4 years, the definition and classification of dystonia have been revised, and new genes have been identified in patients with isolated hereditary dystonia (DYT23, DYT24, and DYT25).
ANO3	dystonia	Compromised anoctamin function is causing a wide range of diseases, such as hearing loss (ANO2), bleeding disorder (ANO6), ataxia and dystonia (ANO3, 10), persistent borrelia and mycobacteria infection (ANO10), skeletal syndromes like gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia and limb girdle muscle dystrophy (ANO5), and cancer (ANO1, 6, 7).
ANO3	cervical dystonia	Some genes, such as ANO3, GNAL and CIZ1, have been discovered for isolated dystonia, but they are probably not a common cause of classic cervical dystonia.
ANO3	hereditary chorea	Clinical and genetic heterogeneity also characterizes myoclonus-dystonia, which includes not only the classical phenotype associated with epsilon-sarcoglycan mutations but rarely also presentation of ANO3 gene mutations, TITF1 gene mutations typically underlying benign hereditary chorea, and some dopamine synthesis pathway conditions due to GCH1 and TH mutations.
CD45	monocytic leukemia	When 10 cases of M5 were subdivided by the differential level into undifferentiated (M5a) and differentiated monocytic leukemia (M5b), expression of CD45RA and CD45RO was strictly restricted to cases with M5a and M5b, respectively.
CCNB3	nodular fasciitis	In this review, we describe the fusion genes recently reported in bone and soft-tissue tumors such as solitary fibrous tumor, aneurysmal bone cyst, nodular fasciitis, CIC-DUX4 fusion gene-positive small round cell tumors, or BCOR-CCNB3-positive sarcoma as well as other genetic aberrations in dedifferentiated liposarcoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor, cartilaginous tumor, Langerhans cell histiocytosis chondroblastoma, or giant cell tumor of the bone.
cytokeratin 7	pancreatic cancer	The individual diagnostic marker positivity was 98% for GATA-binding protein 3, 95% for androgen receptor, 90% for progesterone receptor, 88% for deleted in pancreatic cancer 4, 75% for gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, 72% for cytokeratin 7, 55% for mammaglobin, and 15% for vimentin and Wilms tumor protein 1.
aquaporin-4	major depressive disorder	Astrocyte loss may be caused by cytotoxic T cells as seen in Rasmussen encephalitis, auto-antibodies such as in neuromyelitis optica (aquaporin-4 antibodies), or cytokines such as TNF-Alfa in major depressive disorder.
ATP1A1	hyperaldosteronism	Mutations in KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3 and CACNA1D are found in aldosterone producing adenoma (APA) and familial hyperaldosteronism (FH).
ATP1A1	Cushing's syndrome	Our results suggest that these mutations, in addition to mutations in the KCNJ5 gene and other genes such as ATP1A1, ATP2B3 and CACNA1D, may be responsible for the tumorigenesis of APAs and CPAs with subclinical Cushing's syndrome.
SOX2	cataract	Screening of SOX2 was completed in 89 patients with a variety of ocular anomalies, including 28 with A/M and 61 with normal eye size and anterior segment dysgenesis (28), cataract (14), isolated coloboma (5), or other eye disorders (14).
Kir3.2	Down syndrome	The overexpression of Kir3.2, a subunit of the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K(+) channel, is implicated in some of the neurological phenotypes of Down syndrome (DS).
KPLBS	microcephaly	Keppen-Lubinsky syndrome (KPLBS) is a rare disease mainly characterized by severe developmental delay and intellectual disability, microcephaly, large prominent eyes, a narrow nasal bridge, a tented upper lip, a high palate, an open mouth, tightly adherent skin, an aged appearance, and severe generalized lipodystrophy.
KCNJ6	Down syndrome	We sequenced the exomes of three unrelated individuals affected by KPLBS and found de novo heterozygous mutations in KCNJ6 (GIRK2), which encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel and maps to the Down syndrome critical region between DIRK1A and DSCR4.
MRPs	colitis	We evaluated the impact of glucose-lysine Maillard reaction products (Glc-Lys MRPs) on colitis, induced in rats by an administration of 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water.
MRPs	colitis	Glc-Lys MRPs ameliorate DSS-induced colitis, as determined by a decrease in disease index activity, colon weight/length ratio, nitric oxide levels in serum, recovery of body weight loss, colon length and serum lysozyme levels.
MRPs	colitis	This study was aimed at determining whether repeated low-level exposure to MRPs, generated via two different heat treatments, can contribute to the modulation of experimental colitis in mice.
MRPs	Crohn's disease	Furthermore, we used a sandwich immunoassay to measure serum concentrations of MRPs in 62 patients were simultaneously assessed by the Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) and the severity activity index of Goebell (SAI).
MRPs	ulcerative colitis	In the present study monospecific antibodies against MRPs were used to investigate immunohistochemically the distribution of these proteins in routinely processed bowel tissues from 23 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC).

p65	pneumonia	Although NF-KB RelA (p65) is essential for the expression of many cytokines during pneumonia, its targeted mutation in the lung epithelium was inconsequential for pneumonia-driven LIF induction.
RelA	pneumonia	Overall, our data suggest a signaling axis whereby activation of NF-KB RelA in myeloid cells promotes epithelial LIF induction during lung infections, representing a means through which these two cell types collaborate to improve tissue resilience during pneumonia.
RelA	pneumonia	Sectm1 was induced during the early stages of pneumococcal pneumonia, and mutation of NF-KB RelA in epithelial cells did not diminish its expression.
v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A	pneumonia	To determine the functional significance of the hepatic APR during pneumonia, we challenged APR-null mice lacking hepatocyte signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and v-rel avian reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (RelA) with Escherichia coli in the airspaces.
RelA	pneumonia	Epithelial cells expressed multiple neutrophil-stimulating cytokines during pneumonia, all of which depended on RelA.
RelA	pneumonia	Epithelial RelA mutation decreased whole lung levels of CXCL5 and GM-CSF during pneumococcal pneumonia, whereas lung levels of other neutrophil-recruiting factors were unaffected.
RelA	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis	We demonstrate that RelA-P-Ser536 is a feature of human lung and skin fibroblasts, but not lung epithelial cells, in vitro and is present in sclerotic skin and diseased lungs of patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
p65	pneumonia	Because innate immunity gene induction depends on NF-KB RelA (also known as p65) during pneumonia, we generated a murine model of RelA mutated throughout the alveolar epithelium.
RelA	pneumonia	Sorted cell populations from mouse lungs revealed that CXCL5 was induced during pneumonia in type I cells, which did not require RelA.
RelA	pneumonia	These are also, to our knowledge, the first evidence for entirely RelA-independent pathways of innate immunity gene induction in any cell during pneumonia.

ataxin 2	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	Pathological developments leading to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are associated with misbehavior of several key proteins, such as SOD1 (superoxide dismutase 1), TARDBP/TDP-43, FUS, C9orf72, and dipeptide repeat proteins generated as a result of the translation of the intronic hexanucleotide expansions in the C9orf72 gene, PFN1 (profilin 1), GLE1 (GLE1, RNA export mediator), PURA (purine rich element binding protein A), FLCN (folliculin), RBM45 (RNA binding motif protein 45), SS18L1/CREST, HNRNPA1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1), HNRNPA2B1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1), ATXN2 (ataxin 2), MAPT (microtubule associated protein tau), and TIA1 (TIA1 cytotoxic granule associated RNA binding protein).
SCA2	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia that occurs as a consequence of abnormal CAG expansions in the ATXN2 gene.
ataxin-2	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	Recent findings linking ataxin-2 intermediate expansions to other neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have provided insights into the ataxin-2-related toxicity mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases and have raised new ethical challenges to molecular predictive diagnosis of SCA2.
SCA2	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is among the most common forms of autosomal dominant ataxias, accounting for 15% of the total families.
SCA2	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2	Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is due to a CAG expansion (CAGexp) at ATXN2.
ATXN2	spinocerebellar ataxia type-2	Expansion of polyglutamine trinucleotide (CAG) within ATXN2 gene with 35 or more repeats, results in spinocerebellar ataxia type-2.
Ataxin-2	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	Recent studies have identified the RNA-binding protein Ataxin-2 as a genetic determinant or risk factor for various diseases including spinocerebellar ataxia type II (SCA2) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), amongst others.
AP180	myeloid leukemia	Here we show that synaptobrevin 2 sorting involves determinants within its SNARE motif that are recognized by the ANTH domains of the endocytic adaptors AP180 and clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia (CALM).
synaptosomal-associated protein, 91 kDa homolog	B-cell lymphoma	Specifically, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), desmoglein 2 (DSG2), E3 ubiquitin ligase c-CBL (casitas B-cell lymphoma), cancer/testis antigen NY-ESO-1 (CTAG1A/B), undifferentiated embryonic cell transcription factor 1 (UTF1) and synaptosomal-associated protein, 91 kDa homolog (SNAP91) were shown to represent specific biomarkers of human spermatogonia.
AP180	myeloid leukemia	Recently, the gene encoding clathrin assembly protein of lymphoid myeloid leukemia (CALM), which is homologous to the AP180, was cloned from rat brain, and its expression differential to AP180 was reported (Kim and Lee, 1999).
AP180	myeloid leukemia	The clathrin assembly protein lymphoid myeloid leukemia (CALM) gene, encodes a homologoue of the neuronal clathrin assembly protein AP180.
AP180	myeloid leukemia	The clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia (CALM) gene encodes a putative homologue of the clathrin assembly synaptic protein AP180.
atg7	insulinoma	The expression level of ERp57 was also elevated in rat insulinoma INS-1 cells by inducible knock-down of the atg7-gene.
ATG7	ameloblastoma	Tissue specimens of nine dental follicles and 69 ameloblastomas were immunohistochemically examined with antibodies against ATG7, LC3, and p62.
ATG7	ameloblastoma	Immunohistochemical reactivity for ATG7, LC3, and p62 was detected in many odontogenic epithelial cells and several endothelial cells and fibroblasts in dental follicles and ameloblastomas.
ATG7	ameloblastoma	Expression of ATG7, LC3, and p62 was found markedly in neoplastic cells near the basement membrane rather than central polyhedral cells in ameloblastomas.
ATG7	ameloblastoma	Expression of ATG7, LC3, and p62 in dental follicles and ameloblastomas suggests that autophagy regulation might be affected by microenvironment alterations during tumorigenesis.
Atg7	adenomas	Atg7 deficiency alters progression of Braf(V600E)-driven tumors from adenomas (Braf(V600E); atg7(-/-)) and adenocarcinomas (trp53(-/-); Braf(V600E); atg7(-/-)) to benign oncocytomas that accumulated morphologically and functionally defective mitochondria, suggesting that defects in mitochondrial metabolism may compromise continued tumor growth.
Atg7	adenomas	At later stages of tumorigenesis, Atg7 deficiency resulted in an accumulation of defective mitochondria, proliferative defects, reduced tumor burden, conversion of adenomas and adenocarcinomas to oncocytomas, and increased mouse life span.
Atg7	adenomas	Using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we found that deletion of the essential autophagy gene, Atg7, in KRAS(G12D)-driven NSCLC inhibits tumor growth and converts adenomas and adenocarcinomas to benign oncocytomas characterized by the accumulation of respiration-defective mitochondria.
atg7	adenomas	atg7 loss altered tumor fate from adenomas and carcinomas to oncocytomas-rare, predominantly benign tumors characterized by the accumulation of defective mitochondria.
Atg7	adenomas	Subsequent studies demonstrated that Atg5(-/-) and Atg7(-/-) livers give rise to adenomas, Atg4C(-/-) mice are susceptible to chemical carcinogenesis, and Bif1(-/-) mice are prone to spontaneous tumors, indicating that autophagy defects promote tumorigenesis.
SCARA3	primary peritoneal carcinoma	Scavenger receptor class A, member 3 (SCARA3) was previously found to be overexpressed in ovarian/primary peritoneal carcinoma (OC/PPC) compared with breast carcinoma effusions by global gene expression analysis.
ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein	melanoma	p15RS is a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein that is positively regulated by p15 and, in turn, inhibits the expression of cyclin D and cyclin E. To determine whether p15RS has malignancy inhibitory functions in addition to its inhibitory effects on cell cycle entry, we ectopically expressed p15RS in metastatic melanoma A375 cells, in which p15 gene is deleted and p15RS expression is dramatically downregulated, and examined the effect on various malignant phenotypes.
ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein	Wilms' tumor	Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) has been reported to be a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein.

CGI-58	ichthyosis	We discuss known inborn errors of CTGM, including deficiencies of: AGPAT2 (a form of generalized lipodystrophy), LPIN1 (childhood rhabdomyolysis), LPIN2 (an inflammatory condition, Majeed syndrome, described elsewhere in this issue), DGAT1 (protein loosing enteropathy), perilipin 1 (partial lipodystrophy), CGI-58 (gene ABHD5, neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) with ichthyosis and "Jordan's anomaly" of vacuolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL, gene PNPLA2, NLSD with myopathy, cardiomyopathy and Jordan's anomaly), hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL, gene LIPE, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance).
claudin-3	colon cancer	In current study, we have discovered, using a comprehensive investigative regimen, a novel and tissue-specific role of claudin-3, a tight junction integral protein, in inhibiting colon cancer progression by serving as the common rheostat of Stat-3 and Wnt-signaling activation.
Claudin-3	colon cancer	Claudin-3-/- mice revealed dedifferentiated and leaky colonic epithelium, and developed invasive adenocarcinoma when subjected to colon cancer.
claudin-3	colon cancer	Wnt-signaling hyperactivation, albeit in GSK-3Beta independent manner, differentiated colon cancer in claudin-3-/- mice versus WT-mice.
claudin-3	colon cancer	Genetic and pharmacological studies confirmed that claudin-3 loss induces Wnt/Beta-catenin activation, which is further exacerbated by Stat-3-activation and help promote colon cancer.
claudin-3	colon cancer	Among the paradoxical claudin reaction nuclear localization of marker was observed relatively rarely: claudin-3 in 2.5% cases of colon cancer; claudin-4 in 8.5% of colon polyps.
claudin-3	colon cancer	Mislocalization claudin-3 to nucleus in colon cancer and mislocalization claudin-4 to nucleus in adenomas of the colon were detected for the first time.
claudin-3	colon carcinoma	Our approach aimed at evaluation of a selective and targeted cancer gene therapy of claudin-3- and/or claudin-4- expressing colon carcinoma in vitro and in vivo by using translation optimized CPE expressing vector.

claudin-3	colorectal cancer	To investigate the expression of claudin-3 in colorectal carcinoma and its association with the occurrence, progression and prognosis of colorectal cancer.
Claudin-3	colorectal cancer	Claudin-3 is over-expressed in colorectal cancer tissues, and its high expression may promote the occurrence and progression of colorectal cancer.
claudin-3	colorectal adenocarcinoma	Here, we report that epidermal growth factor (EGF) increases the expression of claudin-3 in human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells.
claudin-3	colorectal cancer	In conclusion, our results show a novel role for claudin-3 overexpression in promoting the malignant potential of colorectal cancer cells, which is potentially regulated by the EGF-activated ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt pathways.
beta-thromboglobulin	essential thrombocythemia	Patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV), complicated by microvascular ischemic or thrombotic events, have shortened platelet survival, increased beta-thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, and thrombomodulin levels, and increased urinary thromboxane B2 excretion.

4 dpi	pneumonia	At 4 dpi a severe fibrinosuppurative bronchopneumonia had developed.
SrGAP3	autism	However, the SrGAP3-deficient mice showed little to no interest in burying marbles; a behavior that is seen in some animal models related to autism, supporting the view that SrGAP3 plays a role in neurodevelopmental disorders.
FGF19	primary biliary cirrhosis	BA synthesis was directly quantified by measuring serum concentrations of 7alpha-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one (C4), along with serum FGF19 and other parameters, in 44 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and 10 healthy subjects.

HSST	Treacher Collins syndrome	Previous studies have resulted in the isolation of the human HSST gene from within the Treacher Collins syndrome locus (TCOF1) critical region on 5q.
HSST	Treacher Collins syndrome	As a result of these studies, mutations within the coding sequence and adjacent splice junctions of HSST can be excluded from a causative role in the pathogenesis of Treacher Collins syndrome.
twist	diabetes mellitus	In univariate analyses, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, ischemic etiology of LBBB, dilated left atrium, reduced LVEF, dilated left ventricle, and impaired LV global strain (GLS &gt; -12.2%, global circumferential strain &gt; -11.8%, and twist &lt; 6.5) showed associations with the composite end point.
twist	diabetes	Individuals with T1D had increased systolic torsion (P = 0.035), systolic torsion rate (P = 0.032), peak Ecl (P = 0.001), and rates of change of systolic (P = 0.007) and diastolic (P = 0.007) Ecl Individuals with T1D, with normal structure, LVEF, and strain, have increased extracellular volume and increased native T1 values with associated augmented torsion and Ecl These measures may be useful in detecting the early stages of diabetic cardiomyopathy and warrant larger prospective studies.NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Individuals with type 1 diabetes, with normal left ventricular structure and function (ejection fraction and strain), have signs of interstitial fibrosis, measured with MRI as increased extracellular volume fraction and increased native myocardial T1, which significantly correlated with a number of measures of augmented left ventricular twist function.
TWIST1	hyperinsulinemia	In this study, we show that hyperinsulinemia in the Rag/MKR mice increases the expression of mesenchymal transcription factors, TWIST1 and ZEB1, and increases the expression of the angiogenesis marker, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA).
twist	diabetes	Aortic PWV correlated crudely with age (p &lt; 0.001), the presence of diabetes (p &lt; 0.001), hypertension (p &lt; 0.001), eGFR (p &lt; 0.001), LVMI (p = 0.01), e/e' (p &lt; 0.001) and LV twist (p = 0.003).
twist	diabetes	There is limited information regarding the role of left ventricular (LV) twist and the effect of exercise in type 2 diabetes (T2D).
twist	diabetes	These results demonstrated that quercetin ameliorates the EMT of HK-2 and NRK-52E cells induced by high glucose and renal fibrosis induced by diabetes, and these effects have been associated with the inhibition of the two transcriptional factors (snail and twist) and the activation of mTORC1/p70S6K.

ALK-5	cancer	Overall, we discussed about the main interactions between ALK-5 and six inhibitors that may be used as starting point for designing of new molecules to the cancer treatment.
ALK5	cancer	In summary, the results suggest that eupatolide suppresses the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells by blocking the canonical ALK5-SMAD3 signaling pathway and the non-canonical ERK and AKT signaling pathways.
TBetaRI	cancer	Expression of a mutant TBetaRI that signals but does not interact with Smad7 prevented the CerS4-mediated inhibition of migration in various cancer cells.
TBetaRI	cancer	TBetaRI-Smo cross-talk at the cilia in CerS4-deficient 4T1 mammary cancer cells induced liver metastasis from orthotopic allografts in both wild-type and CerS4-deficient mice, which was prevented by overexpression of Smad7 or knockdown of intraflagellar transport protein 88 (IFT88).

IL-16	rhinitis	Serum levels of IL-16, IL-33 and the decoy receptor of IL-33, soluble ST2, are elevated in allergic rhinitis.
IL-16	rhinitis	Recent studies show that IL-16, soluble ST2 or anti-IL-33 reduce type 2 cytokines (such as IL-5) and eosinophilia in murine models of allergic asthma or allergic rhinitis respectively.
IL-16	rhinitis	In this study, we studied the release of IL-5, IL-16, IL-33 and soluble ST2 in allergic rhinitis patients after nasal allergen challenge and natural pollen exposure.
IL-16	rhinitis	The observed upregulation of soluble ST2 and IL-16 after nasal allergen challenge and during peak pollination season suggests potential regulatory roles of these cytokines in the inflammatory reaction in allergic rhinitis.
IL-16	rhinitis	To detect the expression and distribution of the lung surfactant protein D (surfactant protein D,SP-D ) and IL-16 in nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps, and then probe into their significance in the pathology of allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps.
IL-16	rhinitis	Fifteen cases of allergic rhinitis, fifteen cases of nasal polyps and fifteen cases of inferior turbinate mucosa were studied to detect the expression of SP-D and IL-16 by immunohistochemistry method.
IL-16	rhinitis	The expression of SP-D and IL-16 in allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps were dramatically higher in controls (P &lt; 0.01).
IL-16	rhinitis	There was no remarkable difference in the expression of SP-D and IL-16 between allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps (P &gt; 0.05).
IL-16	rhinitis	IL-16 is an important eosinophil chemokine in the process of allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps,and it can also enhance the local role of eosinophils,thus it can involve in the process of allergic rhinitis and nasal polyps disease.
IL-16	rhinitis	Though a chemotactin for CD4(+) cells and eosinophils, IL-16 also modulates their production of factors that influence inflammatory lung diseases, e.g., asthma and allergic rhinitis.
IL-16	rhinitis	Interleukin-16 (IL-16) is a cytokine that induces selective migration of CD4+ cells and participates in inflammatory diseases including allergic rhinitis.

IL-16	rhinitis	These results suggest that IL-16 was both systemically and locally upregulated in the murine allergic rhinitis model and that IL-16 changed in parallel to allergic state by treatment with the drugs.
IL-16	rhinitis	The results showed abnormally increased levels of IL-16 (294.4 +/- 15.24 pg/ml), serum eosinophils with absolute count (510.0 +/- 93.57, P&gt;0.05), and total serum IgE (287.9 +/- 61.22 IU/ml) using ELFA in patients of combined asthma and rhinitis, than in each of them alone.
IL-16	rhinitis	We first examined the IL-16 expression of serum and mucosal tissue in patients with allergic rhinitis.
IL-16	rhinitis	IL-16 levels were elevated in the serum of patients with allergic rhinitis compared with normal controls.
IL-16	rhinitis	IL-16 was significantly correlated with eosinophils in the peripheral blood of allergic rhinitis patients.
IL-16	rhinitis	This IL-16 cytokine may be strongly associated with the developmental mechanism of allergic rhinitis.

Sin3B	cancer	Expert opinion: Further identification and characterization of specific Sin3B-containing complexes provide a unique opportunity to prevent the pro-tumorigenic effects of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, and to abrogate cancer stem cell quiescence and the associated resistance to therapy.
SIN3B	prostate cancer	SIN3B has been implicated in the initiation of senescence in vitro Here we show that in a mouse model of prostate cancer, SIN3B provides a barrier to malignant progression.
SIN3B	prostate adenocarcinoma	SIN3B was required for PTEN-induced cellular senescence and prevented progression to invasive prostate adenocarcinoma.
SIN3B	prostate adenocarcinoma	Furthermore, SIN3B was downregulated in human prostate adenocarcinoma correlating with upregulation of its target genes.
SIN3B	prostate adenocarcinoma	Our results suggest a tumor suppressor function for SIN3B that limits prostate adenocarcinoma progression, with potential implications for the use of SIN3B and its target genes as candidate diagnostic markers to distinguish indolent from aggressive disease.
SIN3B	cancer	However, specific roles for SIN3A and SIN3B in breast cancer progression have not been characterized.
SIN3B	cancer	Additionally, we analyzed microarray data sets to identify correlations of SIN3A and SIN3B expression with survival in patients with breast cancer.
SIN3B	cancer	These data sets indicated that high mRNA expression of SIN3A as well as low mRNA expression of SIN3B correlates with longer relapse free survival specifically in patients with triple negative breast cancer which corresponds with our in vitro and in vivo data.
SIN3B	cancer	These results demonstrate key functional differences between SIN3 paralogs in regulating the process of breast cancer metastasis and suggest metastasis suppressive roles of SIN3A and metastasis promoting roles of SIN3B.
SIN3B	cancer	Finally, by immunohistochemical staining of primary breast tissue microarrays we find that EMSY/KDM5A/SIN3B complex subunits are frequently overexpressed in primary breast cancer cases in a correlative manner.
SIN3B	cancer	Here, using a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, we have demonstrated that SIN3B is required for activated KRAS-induced senescence in vivo.
Sin3B	cancer	Furthermore, evaluation of human pancreatic tissue and cancer cells revealed that Sin3B was decreased in control and PDAC samples, compared with samples from patients with pancreatic inflammation.
Sin3B	glioblastoma multiforme	Among proteins in the c-Myc/Max/Mad/Sin3 regulatory complex, Mad4 and Sin3B are routinely detected in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines.

RNF31	cancer	The atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF31 is highly expressed in human breast cancer, the most frequent neoplastic lethality among women.
RNF31	cancer	Here, RNF31 depletion in breast cancer cells in combination with global gene expression profiling revealed p53 (TP53) signaling as a potential RNF31 target.
RNF31	cancer	Interestingly, RNF31 decreased p53 stability, whereas depletion of RNF31 in breast cancer cells caused cell cycle arrest and cisplatin-induced apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner.
RNF31	cancer	Together, our findings suggest RNF31 as a potential therapeutic target to restore p53 function in breast cancer.

SCNN1G	hypokalemia	Liddle syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic condition that causes hypertension and hypokalemia due to a gain-of-function mutation in the SCNN1B or SCNN1G genes which code for the epithelial sodium channel in the kidney.
PHA1	metabolic acidosis	Loss-of-function mutations of the MR are responsible for renal pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1), a rare disease of mineralocorticoid resistance presenting in the newborn with weight loss, failure to thrive, vomiting and dehydration, associated with hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis, despite extremely elevated levels of plasma renin and aldosterone.
PHA-1	pyelonephritis	In the presence of pyelonephritis, the same biochemical picture can occur with transient type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA-1) also termed type 4 renal tubular acidosis.
PHA1	Pseudohypoaldosteronism	Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is a rare genetic disease characterized by resistance to aldosterone, and the renal form of PHA1 is associated with heterozygous inactivating mutations in NR3C2, which encodes mineralocorticoid receptor (MR).

TPL-2	rheumatoid arthritis	Consequently, there has been considerable interest in the pharmaceutical industry to develop selective TPL-2 inhibitors as drugs for the treatment of TNF-dependent inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease.
Tpl2	rheumatoid arthritis	Thus, pharmacologic inhibition of Tpl2 should be a valid approach to therapeutic intervention in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases in humans.
Tpl2	rheumatoid arthritis	Taken together, our results show that inhibition of Tpl2 in primary human cell types can decrease the production of TNFalpha and other pro-inflammatory mediators during inflammatory events, and they further support the notion that Tpl2 is an appropriate therapeutic target for rheumatoid arthritis and other human inflammatory diseases.

CA I	Syndrome	Carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) has an important role in thyroid hormone synthesis via regulating iodide (I-) transport across thyroidal cell membranes and the existence of autoantibodies against CA I and/or CA II have been shown in sera from patient with various autoimmune diseases such as Sjoegren's Syndrome, Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus, type 1 diabetes, primary biliary cirrhosis and ulcerative colitis.
CCR9	Crohn's disease	Efforts to inhibit the chemokine receptor CCR9 using the agent CCX282-B in Crohn's disease were not successful.
CCR9	Crohn's disease	Other therapeuticals that might find their way to the market the coming years include the anti-mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM) PF-00547659, small molecules (including laquinimod and the CCR9 antagonist Vercirnon), as well as an orally active SMAD7 antisense oligonucleotide that showed clinical benefit in Crohn's disease patients.

CCR9	Crohn's disease	Vercirnon is a CCR9 chemokine receptor antagonist being developed for the treatment of Crohn's disease.
NLE	congenital heart block	It is well established that the passive trans-placental passage of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies from mother to foetus is associated with the risk to develop an uncommon syndrome named neonatal lupus (NLE), where the congenital heart block represents the most severe clinical feature.
NLE	second degree heart block	The characteristics of NLE that were studied included congenital complete heart block (CCHB), second degree heart block, and hepatic fibrosis.
NLE	congenital heart block	Sera from patients known to frequently produce precipitating anti-SS-A/Ro antibody (subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus [SCLE], 56 patients; Sjoegren's syndrome [SS], 41 patients; mothers of infants with neonatal LE [NLE], 10 individuals; infants with congenital heart block [CHB], 5 patients) were tested for reactivity to RoSP7-24 in ELISA.
NLE	congenital heart block	NLE is manifested most typically as transient subacute cutaneous lupus lesions or isolated complete congenital heart block.
Paxillin	lung cancer	Our findings also suggested that the inhibitory effects of AC-93253 iodide on lung cancer progression may be attributable to its ability to modulate multiple proteins, including Src, PI3K, JNK, Paxillin, p130cas, MEK, ERK, and EGFR.
Paxillin	lung cancer	Paxillin and FAK activity are reduced in lung cancer cell lines following wiskostatin and nWASP knockdown as shown by immunofluorescence and western blot.
paxillin	lung cancer	Taken together, these results suggested that treatment with DBL may act as a potential candidate to inhibit lung cancer metastasis by inhibiting MMP-2 and -9 via affecting PI3K/AKT, MAPKs, FAK/paxillin, EMT/Snail and Slug, Nrf2/antioxidant enzymes, and NFKB signaling pathways.
paxillin	lung cancer	EL decreased phosphorylation of FAK and its downstream targets, Src, paxillin, and decreased mRNA expression of cell motility-related genes, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in lung cancer cells.
Paxillin	NSCLC	It efficiently inhibits metastasis on NSCLC by reducing vascularization, and eliciting depression of the PI3K-AKT and FAK-Paxillin signaling pathways.
CD101	inflammatory bowel disease	Here, we assessed the impact of CD101 on the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
CD101	colitis	Using a T-cell transfer model of chronic colitis, we found that in recipients of naive T cells from CD101(+/+) donors up to 30% of the recovered lymphocytes expressed CD101, correlating with an increased interleukin (IL)-2-mediated FoxP3 expression.
CD101	colitis	Transfer of CD101(-/-) T cells caused more severe colitis and was associated with an expansion of IL-17-producing T cells and an enhanced expression of IL-2RAlfa/Beta independently of FoxP3.
CD101	colitis	The co-transfer of naive and regulatory T cells (Treg) protected most effectively from colitis, when both donor and recipient mice expressed CD101.
CD101	colitis	Thus, CD101 deficiency is a novel marker for progressive colitis and potential target for therapeutic intervention.
CD101	coeliac disease	Subgroups of T cells (Th : CD4(+) or Tc : CD8(+) ); naive (CD27(+) CD28(+) CD45RA(+) CCR7(+) ), central memory (CD27(+) CD28(+) CD45RA(-) CCR7(+) ), effector memory (early differentiated; CD27(+) CD28(+) CD45RA(-) CCR7(-) and late differentiated; CD27(-) CD28(-) CD45RA(-) CCR7(-) ), terminally differentiated effector cells (TEMRA; CD27(-) CD28(-) CD45RA(+) CCR7(-) ) and Treg (CD4(+) CD25(+) FOXP3(+) CD127(-) ) cells, and their expression of CD39, CD45RA, CD101 and CD129, were studied by flow cytometry in T1D and/or coeliac disease children or without any of these diseases (reference group).
CD101	coeliac disease	Children with exclusively coeliac disease had a higher MFI of CD101 (P &lt; 0*01), as well as a higher percentage of CD129(+) (P &lt; 0*05), in the CD4(+) CD25(hi) lymphocyte population, compared to references.
CD101	coeliac disease	Conversely, children with coeliac disease show signs of CD101(+) /CD129(+) Treg cells that may indicate suppressor activity.
CD101	cholangitis	Further, to define the mechanism of action that explains the differential ability of C57BL/6 Treg versus dnTGF-BetaRII Treg on the ability to down-regulate autoimmune cholangitis, we noted significant differential expression of glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP), CD73, CD101 and CD103 and a functionally significant increase in interleukin (IL)-10 in Treg from C57BL/6 compared to dnTGF-BetaRII mice.
CD101	liver disease	CD101-knockout mice generated on the B6 background also exhibit substantially more severe N. aromaticivorans-induced liver disease correlating with increased IFN-Gamma and IL-17 responses compared with wild-type mice.
plasminogen	gastroduodenitis	Gastric juice from 15 normals, 20 patients with gastric ulcer and 14 patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis was investigated in respect of its activity on unheated and heated fibrin plates and its content of FDP and plasminogen or plasmin with immunochemical methods.
plasminogen	gastroduodenitis	The patients with erosive haemorrhagic gastroduodenitis showed no increase in fibrinolysis in the blood, but low values for plasminogen and alpha2-M, and the serum contained FDP.
TGFBeta2	DORV	In the patient's lymphocytes, mRNA expression of TGFBeta2 was lower than control, and might cause DORV as it does in TGFBeta2-deficient mice.
follistatin	cleft palate	Activin BA, follistatin, and activin receptor type IIA proteins were observed in normal and cleft palate tissues throughout pregnancy (gestational weeks 11 to 40).
follistatin	cleft palate	We have previously shown that follistatin-deficient mice have numerous embryonic defects including shiny, taut skin, growth retardation, and cleft palate leading to death within hours of birth.
coilin	rheumatic disease	Two rheumatic disease patients had a relatively high titer of IgG(2)anti-p80-coilin antibodies.
coilin	autoimmune disease	The IgG(2)subclass of anti-p80-coilin antibodies may be a specific marker for systemic autoimmune disease.
coilin	scleroderma	The patients with localized scleroderma who were positive for anti-p80-coilin antibody had all been classified as having linear scleroderma.
coilin	scleroderma	Our data indicate that anti-p80-coilin antibody is uncommon in skin diseases: however, this antibody is present in patients with a milder form of linear scleroderma, although the incidence of positivity may not be high.
coilin	systemic lupus erythematosus	We also discuss several of the antigen-autoantibody systems found in systemic lupus erythematosus (Smith antigen, U1-nuclear ribonucleoprotein, SS-A/Ro, SS-B/La, proliferating cell nuclear antigen ribosomal ribonucleoprotein, double-strand DNA, histones, antiphospholipids, Ku, Ki/SL), systemic sclerosis (centromere, topo I, RNA polymerases, fibrillarin, polymyositis-Scl, Th/To), polymyositis/dermatomyositis (transferRNA synthetases, signal recognition particle, and others), and SS (SS-A/Ro, SS-B/La, nucleolar organizing region-90, p80-coilin), addressing their clinical significance, common detection methods, immunogenetic associations, and the molecular and cellular biology of the cognate antigens.
IL-17	aortitis	However, IL-17 deficiency did not affect the development of dermatitis at all, in clear contrast to that of arthritis and aortitis.
IL-17	aortitis	The development of arthritis and aortitis was significantly suppressed by the deficiency of TNFalpha or IL-17.
apolipoprotein A-I	Alzheimer's disease	Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been extensively studied in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but little is known of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
ApoA1	Alzheimer's disease	Objective To evaluate the efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum preparation on the behaviors,biochemistry,and autoimmunity parameters of mouse models of APP/PS-1 double transgenic Alzheimer's disease(AD).Methods A total of 44 4-month-old APP/PS-1 double transgenic AD mice were randomly divided into AD model group,Aricept group,Ganoderma lucidum middle-dose(LZ-M)group,and Ganoderma lucidum high-dose(LZ-H)group,with 11 mice in each group.In addition,10 4-month-old C57BL/6 mice were used as the control group.Water maze test was conducted to observe the behavior changes,and the protein expressions in brain tissues were detected by Western blot analysis.The autoimmune indicators were detected by indirect immunofluorescence method.Results In the navigation experiment,the time of finding the platform was gradually shortened since the 2nd day in the control,LZ-H,and LZ-M groups,and the time of searching the platform in the AD model group gradually increased.On the 5th day,the time of finding platform was significantly shorter in control group (t=5.607,P=0.000) and LZ-H group(t=2.750,P=0.010)than AD model group.In the space exploration experiment,the number of crossing the target platform(t=2.452,P=0.025)and the residence time in the target quadrant(t=2.530,P=0.020)in AD model group mice was significantly smaller/shorter than those in control group;in addition,the number of crossing the target platform in the AD model group was significantly smaller than that in LZ-H group(t=2.317,P=0.030)and LZ-M group(t=2.443,P=0.030),while the residence time in target quadrant decreased significantly(t=2.770,P=0.020)compared with LZ-H group;the number of crossing through the target platform quadrant(t=2.493,P=0.022)and residence time in the target quadrant(t=2.683,P=0.015)in LZ-H group were significantly higher than in Aricept group.Western blot analysis showed that the expression of ApoA1 in the brain tissues of mice in LZ-H and LZ-M groups were significantly higher than those in AD model group(P&lt;0.01,P&lt;0.05);ABeta-40 expression in LZ-H group was significantly lower than that in AD model group(P&lt;0.05);the expressions of Syt1,ApoE,and ABCA1 in brain tissues of mice in LZ-H group were significantly higher than those in model group(P&lt;0.01,P&lt;0.05).The plasma IgG level in Aricept group(t=30.945,P=0.000),LZ-M group(t=25.639,P=0.000)and LZ-H group(t=4.689,P=0.001)were significantly higher than that in the control group.Conclusion Ganoderma lucidum preparation can improve behavior disorders of AD model mice,promote the expressions of ApoA1,ApoE and Syt1,inhibit the expression of ABeta-40 protein,and improve the autoimmune function.
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit A	carcinoma	We aimed to explore the correlations between eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit A (eIF3a) polymorphisms and susceptibility to and chemoradiotherapy efficacy in cervical carcinoma.
eIF3a	carcinoma	Compared with carriers of the CC genotype, carriers of the T genotype of the eIF3a Arg803Lys C&gt;T polymorphism had a higher risk of cervical carcinoma.
eIF3a	carcinoma	Univariate analysis revealed that age, eIF3a Arg803Lys C&gt;T polymorphism, differentiation degree, FIGO stage, and LNM were prognostic factors of cervical carcinoma, and multivariate analysis showed that age &gt;= 60 years, higher FIGO stage, and LNM, as well as the CT and TT genotypes of the eIF3a Arg803Lys C&gt;T polymorphism, were risk factors related to the prognosis of cervical carcinoma.
eIF3a	carcinoma	The eIF3a Arg803Lys C&gt;T polymorphism is connected with a higher susceptibility to cervical carcinoma and may affect chemoradiotherapy efficacy in and prognosis of cervical carcinoma.
p185	adenocarcinomas	These findings suggest that the p185 neu may be a prognostic indicator not only for breast adenocarcinomas but also for lymphoproliferative disorders, and that the transforming p185 protein may be involved in the mechanisms of aggressive expansion of lymphoid neoplasias.
p185	cancer	The authors investigated the correlation between clinicopathologic factors and the overexpression of the p185(HER2) in Korean gastric adenocarcinoma patients, and determined whether the antiproliferative effects of anti- p185(HER2) antibody can also be observed on gastric cancer cell lines that overexpress this growth factor receptor.
p185	carcinoma	We evaluated the relationship between p185(HER2) overexpression and clinicopathological features in 94 (M: F=52: 42) gastric adenocarcinoma patients (median age 59 years).
p185	cancer	To explore the role of humanized anti-p185(HER2) monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin ) in vitro, the growth curve of Korean gastric cancer cells that overexpress the p185(HER2) protein was studied and a cell cycle analysis was performed.
p185	cancer	p185(HER2) overexpression was found to be more frequent in advanced gastric cancer than early gastric cancer (54.1% vs 24.2%, p=0.008).
p185	cancer	Among several Korean gastric cancer cell lines, SNU-1, SNU-5, and SNU-620 overexpress p185(HER2).
p185	cancer	Trastuzumab inhibited the proliferation of p185(HER2) overexpressed Korean gastric cancer cell line by 21% with down-regulation of p185(HER2) protein expression.
p185	carcinoma	S: Taken together, our observations suggest the potential prognostic significance of p185(HER2) overexpression in Korean gastric adenocarcinoma patients and point to the need for further research on this mechanism.
p185	cancer	This suggests the possible use of p185(HER2) as a therapeutic target in gastric cancer.
p185	cancer	Administration of trastuzumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody targeted to the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, p185), has improved outcomes for patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer (GC), but some relevant issues remain to be investigated and will emerge with new anti-GC drugs.
Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit A	lung cancer	Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit A (eIF3a) plays critical roles in regulating the initiation of protein translation, and eIF3a is highly expressed in lung cancer.

eIF3a	cancer	RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry was used to examine eIF3a and HE4 mRNA or protein expression in ovarian tissues from patients with ovarian cancer (n=181) or benign ovarian tumors, or from the healthy women.
eIF3a	cancer	There were significant differences in mRNA and protein expression of eIF3a and HE4 among normal ovarian tissues, benign ovarian tumor tissues, and ovarian cancer tissues (P&lt; 0.05).
eIF3a	cancer	There were significant differences in mRNA expression of eIF3a and HE4 between the normal tissues and the ovarian cancer tissues, or between the benign ovarian tumor tissues and the normal tissues (P&lt; 0.001).
eIF3a	cancer	The mRNA expression of eIF3a in the normal ovarian tissues was significantly higher than that in the benign ovarian tumor tissues or that in the ovarian cancer tissues.
eIF3a	cancer	Positive expression rates for eIF3a or HE4 protein in normal, benign tumor, and cancer tissues were 0, 66.7%, and 81.0% or 0, 27.8%, and 56.2%, respectively.
eIF3a	cancer	There were significant differences in positive expression rates of eIF3a protein and HE4 protein between the ovarian tumor tissues and benign ovarian tumor tissues, between the ovarian cancer tissues and the normal ovarian tissues, or between the benign ovarian tumor tissues and the normal ovarian tissues (P&lt; 0.001).
eIF3a	cancer	The expressions of eIF3a and HE4 are associated with ovarian cancer, and extracellular regulated protein kinases may play a role in the interaction between eIF3a and HE4.

B47	congenital adrenal hyperplasia	The HLA-B47,DR7 haplotype in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency contains a deletion of most of the active CYP21 gene and the entire adjacent C4B gene.
B47	congenital adrenal hyperplasia	The HLA haplotype A3-Cw6-B47-C4A91-BQ0-DR7 is associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), since it only carries the dysfunctional steroid 21-hydroxylase A pseudogene as well as the 5' adjacent complement C4A gene.
VAPB	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	The mutation of vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein B (VAPB) was proved to cause family amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS).
VAPB	ALS8	ALS8 is a late-onset familial autosomal dominant form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) caused by a point mutation (P56S) in the VAPB gene (VAMP associated protein isoform B).
VAPB	ALS8	This supports the loss of VAPB function in ALS8 pathogenesis and suggests that reducing intracellular PtdIns4P might be an effective therapeutic strategy in delaying progressive loss of motor neurons.
VAP-B	Lou-Gehrig's disease	Mutations in VAP-B that have been identified in familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou-Gehrig's disease) cause aggregation of the VAP-B protein, which then impairs its binding to several proteins, including Nir2.
VAPB	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis	A mutation in VAPB causes a familial form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.

12-LO	asthma	Consistent with these findings, we observed that in an IL-33-administered asthmatic airway inflammation model, IL-13 levels were markedly increased in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, but its levels were markedly suppressed by treatment with inhibitors of 5-LO, 12-LO or BLT2, further suggesting roles of 5-/12-LO in IL-33-induced IL-13 production.
12-LO	asthma	Our results suggest that "MyD88-5-/12-LO-BLT2-NF-KB" cascade significantly contributes to the IL-33-induced synthesis of IL-13 in mast cells, thus potentially contributing to asthmatic development and exacerbation.

CYP	LCA	However, the effects of the potential herb-drug interactions (HDIs) between LCA and therapeutic drugs on the inhibition of human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes remain unclear.
CYP	LCA	In the present study, the inhibitory effects of LCA on seven major human CYP isoforms, including CYP1A2, 2D6, 2E1, 2C19, 2C8, 2C9 and 3A4, were investigated in human liver microsomes (HLMs).
CYP	LCA	The results demonstrated that LCA significantly inhibited the activities of CYP1A2, 2C19, 2C8, 2C9 and 3A4 and exhibited weak inhibitory effects on CYP2E1 and CYP2D6.
CYP	LCA	Dixon and Lineweaver-Burk plots revealed that the inhibition types of LCA against CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19 and 2C8 were best fit as mixed-type inhibitions, while LCA was a competitive inhibitor towards CYP3A4.
CYP	LCA	Furthermore, the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves (AUCs) of several drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYPs were estimated to increase by 2-398% in the presence of LCA, which suggested that LCA exhibited high HDI potentials via CYP inhibition.

NOLC1	nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Previous studies suggest that NOLC1 is crucial for normal cell growth, and plays a role in the regulation of tumorigenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and demonstrate that both NOLC1 and tumor protein 53 work synergistically to activate the MDM2 promoter in NPC cells.
NOLC1	cancer	Yet, the functioning of NOLC1 in liver cancer remains unknown.
NOLC1	cancer	In this study, we showed that NOLC1 was silenced or downregulated in liver tumor tissues when compared with that in the matched non-cancer tissues.
NOLC1	cancer	Low expression of NOLC1 in hepatoma cell lines and liver cancer tissues was associated with cyclin D3.
NOLC1	hepatocellular carcinoma	In conclusion, our study demonstrated that DNA methylation is a key mechanism of silenced NOLC1 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and NOLC1 gene hypermethylation of the four CpG dinucleotides is a potential biomarker for hepatocellular carcinoma.
NOLC1	Severe combined immunodeficiency	Severe combined immunodeficiency mice bearing NPC xenografts derived from NOLC1-short hairpin-RNA-transfected animals were found to have 82% lower levels of tumor growth than control mice as well as marked tumor cell apoptosis.

vascular cell adhesion molecule-1	alpha-thalassemia	The aim of the study was to examine the effects of exercise on soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) in sickle cell trait (SCT) athletes with or without alpha-thalassemia.
VCAM-1	HbH	As compared to normal, increased sICAM-1 was found in beta-thal/HbE patients with non-splenectomy; BE-NS (p = 0.002), increased ELAM-1 in beta-thal/HbE patients with splenectomy; BE-S (p = 0.01) and HbH with Hb Constant Spring; HbH/CS (p = 0.001), and increased sVCAM-1 in BE-NS; (p = &lt; 0.0001) and BE-S (p = 0.002).
ROR	allergic rhinitis	Furthermore, treatment with AST or DEX significantly suppressed the mRNA and protein expression levels of the transcription factor GATA-3 and retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor (ROR)Gammat in tissue samples isolated from the spleen and nasal mucosa of mice with allergic rhinitis.
ROR	allergic rhinitis	The present results suggested that treatment with AST may attenuate OVA-induced allergic rhinitis via regulating the expression of the transcription factors GATA-3, RORGammat, T-bet and Foxp3, which commit T helper cells to the Th1 phenotype.
AHAs	hypoglycemia	Canagliflozin was associated with a low incidence of hypoglycemia when used with background AHAs that are not associated with hypoglycemia; the incidence was higher among patients on background AHAs associated with hypoglycemia (i.e.
AHAs	hypoglycemia	Canagliflozin was associated with a low incidence of hypoglycemia when not used in conjunction with AHAs associated with hypoglycemia (i.e., insulin or sulfonylurea).
AHAs	hypoglycemia	Adding different AHAs to metformin was associated with varying effects on HbA1c, BW, SBP, hypoglycemia, UTI and GTI which should impact clinician choice when selecting adjunctive therapy.
MT-TL2	atherosclerosis	It has been shown at least four mutations of mitochondrial genome, namely, A1555G in MT-RNR1 gene, C3256T in MT-TL1 gene, G12315A in MT-TL2 gene, and G15059A in MT-CYB gene have significantly higher prevalence and mean value in lipofibrous plaques as compared to non-atherosclerotic intima, and therefore are associated with atherosclerosis.
MT-TL2	atherosclerosis	Ten mitochondrial mutations belonging to mitochondrial genes MT-RNR1 (rRNA 12S); MT-TL1 (tRNA-Leu, recognizes UUR); MT-TL2 (tRNA-Leu, recognizes CUN); MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND5, and MT-ND6 (subunits 1, 2, 5, and 6, respectively, of NADH dehydrogenase); and MT-CYB (cytochrome b) were potentially associated with atherosclerosis.
m asl	chikungunya	The vectors of chikungunya and dengue virus, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, the vector of lymphatic filariasis, Culex quinquefasciatus, and that of Japanese encephalitis, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, were found from 70 to 2,000 m asl in eastern Nepal.
3q27	trisomy 18	The results of an examination of a paraffin block histopathology specimen by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) showed no mucosa associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) (18q21.1), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) (18q21.3), or BCL6 (3q27) split signals in either the uterus or the greater omentum, however, trisomy 18 was detected in approximately 50%-70% of the tumor cells in both the uterus and the greater omentum.
3q27	trisomy 18	The following abnormalities were most frequently observed: rearrangements involving 14q32, 19q13, 19p13, 1p, 3q27, and 8q24; del(6q); dup(1q); and trisomy 18.
Arc/Arg3.1	epilepsy	Passive avoidance test showed four Group rats shuttle times were 6.8+/-0.6, 1.2+/-0.2, 5.4+/-0.5, 3.6+/-0.3, incubation period were 26.1+/-3.9, 152.2+/-12.9, 65.8+/-7.0, 91.2+/-9.1, and water maze test had the same trend, with values in epilepsy groups significantly lower than the normal group of rats, which meant cognitive dysfunction.The above results also showed Baclofen further inhibited the learning and memory ability of the rats and CGP35348 promoted the learning and memory ability.The results of the Arc/Arg3.1 and GB1, GB2 level detection showed that epilepsy groups had significantly higher expression levels of Arc/Arg3.1 and GB1, GB2 than the normal group.Comparison among epilepsy groups showed that Baclofen group expressed lower levels of Arc/Arg3.1 and expressed higher levels of GB1, GB2, however CGP35348 group expressed higher levels of Arc/Arg3.1 and expressed lower levels of GB1, GB2.
prohormone convertase 1	corticotroph adenoma	To search for the mechanism causing clinically silent corticotroph adenoma, we immunohistochemically examined the expression of prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3) in this type of adenoma and compared our results with those obtained for Cushing's disease.
FTS	arthritis	In the present study, we tested the therapeutic and immunomodulatory effects of FTS and its derivative 5-fluoro-FTS (F-FTS) in the rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model (AIA).
FTS	tenosynovitis	MR features were scored (0-3) following the Oslo hand OA score: BMLs, synovitis, cysts, flexor tenosynovitis (FTS).
FTS	synovitis	BMLs, synovitis, cysts, FTS and ETI were demonstrated in 56%, 90%, 22%, 16% and 30% of patients, respectively.
FTS	synovitis	BMLs (grade 2/3 vs 0: 3.5 (1.6-7.7)) and synovitis (3 vs 0: OR 3.6 (95% CI 1.9-6.6)) were severity-dependent associated with joint pain, but FTS and ETI were not.
FTS	tenosynovitis	Infectious flexor tenosynovitis (FTS) is a serious infection of the hand and wrist that can lead to necrosis and amputation without prompt diagnosis and surgical debridement.
FTS	arthritis	Our objective in this work was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of the Ras inhibitor farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS) on adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) in rats, an experimental model for RA.
FTS	tenosynovitis	Diabetic patients are susceptible to stenosing flexor tenosynovitis (FTS) and may have a diminished response to treatment.
FTS	osteoporosis	With the rising participation of women in sports events, the prevalence of eating disorders and the female athlete triad (FTS), a syndrome of disordered eating, amenorrhea, and osteoporosis, have also increased in recent years.
FTS	tenosynovitis	Dupuytren's contracture (DC) (42 vs. 29.3%, respectively; P=0.01), limited joint mobility (LJM) (39 vs. 28.5%, respectively; P=0.01) and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) (5.3 vs. 1%, respectively; P=0.01) were significantly higher in T2DM patients than in the controls, but not stenosing flexor tenosynovitis (FTS, 'trigger finger').
gastrin	colorectal cancer	Data from several studies suggest that the gastrin family of growth factors potentiates colorectal cancer tumourigenesis.
gastrin	colorectal cancer	The aim of this study was to investigate whether progastrin expression may predict clinical outcome in colorectal cancer.
gastrin	colorectal cancer	This is the first study to show that progastrin expression may be predictive of aggressive tumour behaviour in patients with colorectal cancer and supports its clinical relevance and potential use as a biomarker.
gastrin	colorectal cancer	The aim of this study was to analyze plasma concentrations of enterohormones (motilin, ghrelin, gastrin and pancreatic polypeptide) and to verify if their abnormal levels may contribute to the severity of dyspeptic symptoms in colorectal cancer patients.
gastrin	colon cancer	This study examined the expression level, subcellular localization, and binding activity of CacyBP/SIP in human colon cancer cells in the presence and absence of the hormone gastrin.
gastrin	colon cancer	CacyBP/SIP promoted the cell proliferation of colon cancer cells under both basal and gastrin stimulated conditions as shown by knockdown studies.
gastrin	colorectal cancer	As treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) increases the biosynthesis and secretion of gastrin, it has been postulated that treatment with PPIs could increase the risk of cancer, especially in Barrett's esophagus, gastric carcinoids, and colorectal cancer (CRC).
gastrin	duodenal gastrinoma	Pathological studies showed lymph nodes metastasis in 2 patients with pancreatic gastrinomas, and in one patient with duodenal gastrinoma.
B7-DC	diabetes	A progressive increase in the expression of PD-1 and B7-H1/B7-DC on T cells and APC, respectively, was observed in the pancreatic lymph nodes of female non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice as they developed diabetes.
B7-DC	diabetes	B7-H1 and B7-DC have negative regulatory effects upon binding PD-1 on activated T cells and B7-H1 deficiency increases severity of both diabetes and EAE.
KIR3DL2	mycosis fungoides	These characteristics have implicated KIR3DL2 in several pathologies: ankylosing spondylitis and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas such as Sezary syndrome, CD30+ cutaneous lymphoma, and transformed mycosis fungoides.
KIR3DL2	mycosis fungoides	KIR3DL2, an inhibitory receptor expressed by natural killer cells and a subset of normal CD8(+) T cells, is aberrantly expressed in neoplastic cells in transformed mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome.
CD158k	mycosis fungoides	Not only we confirmed the expression of this marker in the blood and/or skin of mycosis fungoides patients but we also show for the first time CD158k expression (often associated with CD160) on cutaneous CD4+ T cells from healthy individuals (25.3 +/- 15%).
CD158k	mycosis fungoides	Therefore, CD4+ CD160+ T cells expressing CD158k might represent specialized cutaneous lymphocytes devoted to immune surveillance, from which could originate cutaneous T-cell lymphomas such as mycosis fungoides.
KIR3DL2	mycosis fungoides	p140/KIR3DL2 has been identified in malignant cell lines isolated from the skin and blood of patients with transformed mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sezary's syndrome (SS).
DS e	gastroschisis	Chromosomal aberration (DS especially) are among the most frequent prenatally diagnosed birth defects, further being heart defects, neural tube defects (anencephaly, encephalocele, spina bifida), hydrocephalus, congenital skeletal system defects, abdominal wall defects (omphalocele, gastroschisis) and renal defects.
DS e	gastroschisis	In some defects, prenatal diagnostics has also significantly influenced their incidence in births (anencephaly, gastroschisis and DS e.g.
Mck	Friedreich ataxia	The Fxn KO/Mck model reproduces some key features of patients with Friedreich ataxia and provides an opportunity of ameliorating their symptoms with experimental therapies.
ARSB	Legg-Calve-Perthes disease	Further confirmation is obtained with identification of two mutations in the ARSB gene for MPS VI or mutations in the GALNS gene for MPS IVA.We report slowly progressing patients, one with MPS VI and two with MPS IVA, who presented with skeletal changes and hip findings resembling Legg-Calve-Perthes disease or spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and normal/near normal urine GAG levels.
4E-34	ulcerative colitis	We identified genes that might be truly causative, but GWAS might have failed to identify for 148 out of the GWAS-identified SNPs; for example, TUFM (P = 3.3E-48) was identified for inflammatory bowel disease (early onset); ZFP90 (P = 4.4E-34) for ulcerative colitis; and IDUA (P = 2.2E-11) for Parkinson's disease.
ABPA	bronchitis	Apart from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and mould-caused mycoses, only sufficient evidence for an association between moisture/mould damage and the following health effects has been established: allergic respiratory disease, asthma (manifestation, progression and exacerbation), allergic rhinitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis), and increased likelihood of respiratory infections/bronchitis.
ABPA	bronchitis	We studied the relationship between GORD and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA), or Aspergillus bronchitis.
ABPA	bronchitis	We reviewed four patients referred with elevated Aspergillus serology markers and marked pulmonary symptoms for ABPA, CPA, and Aspergillus bronchitis, and discussed the underlying pathophysiological relationship with GORD.
ABPA	bronchitis	Data were collected retrospectively from medical records included age, gender, predisposing factors for ABPA, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, or Aspergillus bronchitis; presence of nocturnal reflux, nausea, epigastric pain, Medical Research Council dyspnea scale score, pH manometry data, endoscopic results (ulcers, Barrett's esophagus), treatment of GORD [proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), surgical operation]; history of smoking, alcohol consumption; concomitant COPD; serological markers (anti-Aspergillus IgG, anti-Aspergillus IgE), and antifungal treatment.
ABPA	bronchitis	One had ABPA, one CPA, and two had Aspergillus bronchitis; median age was 57 years [range 39-71]; males-to-females ratio was 1:3.
ABPA	bronchitis	Apart from the allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and the mycoses caused by mold, there is only sufficient evidence for the following associations between moisture/mold damages and different health effects: Allergic respiratory diseases, asthma (manifestation, progression, exacerbation), allergic rhinitis, exogenous allergic alveolitis and respiratory tract infections/bronchitis.
ABPA	bronchitis	can lead to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), Aspergillus sensitisation and Aspergillus bronchitis in CF.
ABPA	bronchitis	Published proportions of ABPA (17.7%), Aspergillus sensitisation (14.6%) and Aspergillus bronchitis (30%) in CF were applied to those &gt;18 years and compared with notified ABPA cases.
ABPA	bronchitis	Aspergillus sensitisation, associated with increased bronchiectasis and reduced FEV1, affects an anticipated 5,506 patients without ABPA or Aspergillus bronchitis.
ABPA	bronchitis	Together ABPA and Aspergillus bronchitis are estimated to affect 17,989 adults, 47.7% of the adult CF population.
ABPA	bronchitis	Itraconazole is prescribed for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) or Aspergillus bronchitis in CF subjects.
ABPA	bronchitis	We selected an average of five serum samples from each of the 17 patients with ABPA (13 proven and 4 probable ABPA) and from 3 patients with Aspergillus bronchitis and rhinosinusitis.
ABPA	bronchitis	Patients were diagnosed with ABPA and Aspergillus bronchitis related to innate immune defects.
ABPA	bronchitis	Yeasts and filamentous fungi are beginning to emerge as significant microbial pathogens in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), particularly in relation to allergic-type responses, as seen in patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), Aspergillus bronchitis and in invasive fungal disease in lung transplant patients.
CK 19	Paget's disease	On the other hand, a widespread positive reaction for CK 5/8, CK 7, CK 19, and negative reaction for CK 10, was a helpful feature in the differentiation of Paget's disease from Bowen's disease and BAK.
leptin	renal osteodystrophy	To date, the relation between serum leptin levels of dialysis patients and renal osteodystrophy, defined by histomorphometric and histodynamic parameters of bone, has not been studied.
B-can	gastroenteritis	For 100 years, it has been obvious that Salmonella enterica strains sharing the serotype with the formula 1,4,[5],12:b:1,2-now known as Paratyphi B-can cause diseases ranging from serious systemic infections to self-limiting gastroenteritis.
HSPC	cancer	Interestingly, in the case of breast cancer patients, this phenomenon correlated with high expression level of several molecular chaperones belonging to the HSPA, DNAJB and HSPC families.
HSPC	lymphoma	Unexpectedly, conditioning before HSPC infusion was required to protect the mice from lymphoma developing when transplanting small numbers of progenitors.
HSPC	cancer	Here, we evaluated the potency of highly active NK cells derived from human CD34+ haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) to infiltrate and mediate killing of human ovarian cancer spheroids using an in vivo-like model system and mouse xenograft model.
HSPC	cancer	These CD56+Perforin+ HSPC-NK cells were generated under stroma-free conditions in the presence of StemRegenin-1, IL-15, and IL-12, and exerted efficient cytolytic activity and IFNGamma production toward ovarian cancer monolayer cultures.
HSPC	cancer	Live-imaging confocal microscopy demonstrated that these HSPC-NK cells actively migrate, infiltrate, and mediate tumor cell killing in a three-dimensional multicellular ovarian cancer spheroid.
HSPC	ovarian carcinoma	Furthermore, intraperitoneal HSPC-NK cell infusions in NOD/SCID-IL2RGammanull (NSG) mice bearing ovarian carcinoma significantly reduced tumor progression.
HSPC	ovarian carcinoma	These findings demonstrate that highly functional HSPC-NK cells efficiently destruct ovarian carcinoma spheroids in vitro and kill intraperitoneal ovarian tumors in vivo, providing great promise for effective immunotherapy through intraperitoneal HSPC-NK cell adoptive transfer in ovarian carcinoma patients.
HSPC	leukemia	Treatment with vitamin C, a co-factor of Fe2+ and Alfa-KG-dependent dioxygenases, mimics TET2 restoration by enhancing 5-hydroxymethylcytosine formation in Tet2-deficient mouse HSPCs and suppresses human leukemic colony formation and leukemia progression of primary human leukemia PDXs.
IL-16	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	We quantified extracellular IL-16 protein (ELISA) and intracellular IL-16 in NK cells, T-cells, B-cells, and monocytes (flow cytometry) in blood samples from long-term tobacco smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in never-smokers.
IL-16	asthma	In asthmatic children with positive ETC, monocyte hemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and IL-16 adjusted to pre-EBC forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were significantly higher compared to children with negative ETC (p = 0.022 and p = 0.017 respectively).
IL-16	silicosis	Compared with the control group, silica dust exposed group, the observation group of objects, the pneumosilicosis patients of IL-16 in induced sputum IL-16 (21.40 +/- 9.24) decreased, the content of PDGF [(5.96 +/- 0.51) ng/L], MMP-2 [(447.86 +/- 27.10) ng/L], MMP-9 [(223.91 +/- 12.28) ng/L], MCP-1 [(122.87 +/- 6.08) ng/L] increased, the differences are statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05).
IL-16	silicosis	As silicosis biomarkers, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, IL-16, PDGF, MMP-2, MMP-9 and MCP-1 have certain significance, further suggesting that early detection rate of patients with silicosis can be improved by employing the multiple indexes discriminate equation.
IL-16	asthma	By contrast, compared to eosinophil-normal asthma (eosinophils&lt;=0.3%), eosinophil-high asthma (eosinophils&gt;0.3%) had higher levels of IL-5, IL-13, IL-16, and PDGF-bb, but same neutrophil percentage, IL-8, and FEV1.
DRG1	adenocarcinomas	Here, we demonstrate that DRG1 is elevated in lung adenocarcinomas while weakly expressed in adjacent lung tissues.
developmentally regulated GTP-binding protein 1	melanoma	To this end, we describe the identification of developmentally regulated GTP-binding protein 1 (DRG-1) as a melanoma-associated antigen recognized by HLA-DR11-restricted CD4(+) Th1 cells.
DRG-1	melanoma	Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that DRG-1 was highly expressed in melanoma cell lines but not in normal tissues.
DRG-1	melanoma	DRG-1 knockdown by lentiviral-based shRNA suppressed melanoma cell proliferation and soft agar colony formation.
DRG1	melanoma	Taken together, these data suggest that DRG-1 plays an important role in melanoma cell growth and transformation, indicating that DRG1 may represent a novel target for CD4(+) T cell-mediated immunotherapy in melanoma.
FBXW7	glioma	FBXW7 mRNA was identified as a direct target of miR-155 in glioma.
FBXW7	glioma	Finally, we found that MALAT1 positively regulated FBXW7 expression, which was responsible for glioma progression mediated by MALAT1-miR-155 pathway.
Fbxw7	glioma	Besides those, Fbxw7 activity is controlled at different levels, resulting in specific and tunable regulation of the abundance and activity of its substrates in a variety of human solid tumor types, including glioma malignancy, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, osteosarcoma, melanoma as well as colorectal, lung, breast, gastric, liver, pancreatic, renal, prostate, endometrial, and esophageal cancers.
FBXW7	GBM	Subsequently, miR-15/16 activities are reduced and many of their direct targets are de-repressed, including ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 that destabilizes Cyclin E. Conversely, GBM cells expressing low p21 level, or after p21 knock-down, exhibit weaker or no E2F1 response to miR-10b inhibition.
FBXW7	glioma	Notch pathway genes are overexpressed in ependymomas and gliomas along with FBXW7 downregulation.
Fbxw7	glioma	We propose that p53 mutations contribute to gliomagenesis by both allowing the overexpression of c-Myc through downregulation of Fbxw7 and by protecting against c-Myc-induced apoptosis.
nNOS	PMD	PMD is located adjacent and medial to the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (PH) in the dorsal medulla and is distinguished by the pattern of immunoreactivity of cells and fibers to several markers including calcium-binding proteins, a synthetic enzyme for nitric oxide (neuronal nitric oxide synthase, nNOS) and a nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein (antibody SMI-32).
nNOS	PMD	Cells in PMD are also immunoreactive to nNOS, and immunoreactivity to a neurofilament protein shows many labeled cells and fibers.
OP1	periodontitis	Regardless of the type of surgery (PRE-OP, POS-OP1, POS-OP2), the prevalence of periodontitis proved to be high (81.45%).
OP1	periodontitis	There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of periodontitis among the PRE-OP, POS-OP1, and POS-OP2 groups (P = 0.040).
hOP-1	periodontitis	Long-term studies with gamma-irradiated 0.5 and 2.5mg hOP-1 per gram of xenogeneic bovine collagenous matrix induce the restitutio ad integrum of the periodontal tissues in furcation defects exposed by chronic periodontitis in P. ursinus.
BMP 7	periodontitis	Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP 7) induces cementogenesis in periodontitis-associated periodontal ligament (PDL) defects.

serine/threonine-protein kinase b-raf	NSCLC	We highlight common mechanistic themes underpinning resistance to targeted therapies that are shared by NSCLC subtypes, including those with oncogenic alterations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS1 proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1), serine/threonine-protein kinase b-raf (BRAF) and other less established oncoproteins.
v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B	sarcoma	Here, we investigated the response of normal human keratinocytes to the MEK inhibitors trametinib and cobimetinib, alone and in combination with the v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) inhibitors dabrafenib and vemurafenib, in terms of signal transduction and de novo gene expression.
v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1	colorectal cancer	The prognostic role of the V600E mutation of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is well established, but the therapeutic regimen targeting this disease is lacking.
BRAF	neuroblastoma	Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS), and BRAF mutational status was assayed using direct sequencing.
serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF	melanoma	We performed an unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen on melanoma cells that were both resistant and addicted to inhibition of the serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF, in order to functionally mine their genome for 'addiction genes'.
BRAF	melanoma	In patients with melanoma that had progressed during treatment with a BRAF inhibitor, treatment cessation was followed by increased expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, which is associated with the phenotype switch.
v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1	sarcoma	v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF)-mutant anaplastic xanthoastrocytomas and gangliogliomas may benefit from BRAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors.
proto-oncogene B-raf	NSCLC	Mutations in the proto-oncogene B-raf (BRAF) occur in approximately 3% of NSCLC cases.
BRAF	cancer	To our knowledge, this is only the second well-documented case of gastrointestinal metastasis from BRAF-mutated lung cancer.
v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B	sarcoma	Changes in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS), v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF), gene encoding neurofibromin (NF1), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and ROS1 are the main genes that suffer alterations in the tumors of patients with ADC.
GRID	AIDS	For example, "Mongolism" was changed to Down's syndrome; "Australia" antigen to HBsAg; "Mexican" Swine flu to H1N1; "GRID" (Gay Related Immune Deficiency) and 4H-Disease (Haitians, Homosexuals, Haemophiliacs and Heroin Users Disease) to AIDS.
GRID	AIDS	WHEN IT WAS CALLED 'GRID': One year ago today, I told my colleagues that I was dying of AIDS.
proton-pump	cystic fibrosis	APL are significantly influenced by azole dose, age, cystic fibrosis, type of LTx, and comedication with proton-pump inhibitors.
proton pump	multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1	DMSG = DutchMEN1 Study Group; D-NET = duodenal neuroendocrine tumor; DP-NET = duodenopancreatic neuroendocrine tumor; HPF = high-power field; Ki67 LI = Ki67 labeling index; MEN1 = multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1; NET = neuroendocrine tumor; OS = overall survival; P-NET = pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor; PPI = proton pump inhibitor; ULN = upper limit of normal; WHO = World Health Organization.

proton pump	multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1	In both cases, the diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 was made after proton pump therapy was discontinued.
proton pump	multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1	Clinical assessment for features of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (eg, serum calcium levels, personal and family history of hypercalcemia, pituitary or pancreatic tumors) could identify patients with higher risk for a tumoral source of hypergastrinemia where imaging studies can help support the diagnosis without the potential side effects of abrupt discontinuation of proton pump inhibitor therapy.
proton pump	HGPs	No correlation was detected between Ki-67 values of HGPs in CLD patients and the presence of portal hypertension, infection with Helicobacter pylori, or proton pump inhibitor use.
TUBA4A	frontotemporal dementia	Mutation screening and phenotypic profiling of 2 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-(ALS) and frontotemporal dementia-(FTD) associated genes, CHCHD10 and TUBA4A, were performed in a Belgian cohort of 459 FTD, 28 FTD-ALS, and 429 ALS patients.
TUBA4A	Parkinson's disease	In TUBA4A, we detected a novel frameshift mutation (p.Arg64Glyfs*90) leading to a truncated protein in 1 FTD patient (1/459 of 0.22%) with family history of Parkinson's disease and cognitive impairment, and a novel missense mutation (p.Thr381Met) in 2 sibs with familial ALS and memory problems (1 index patient/429, 0.23%) in whom we previously identified a pathogenic Chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 repeat expansion mutation.
TUBA4A	Parkinson's disease	The present study confirms the role of CHCHD10 and TUBA4A in the FTD-ALS spectrum, although genetic variations in these 2 genes are extremely rare in the Belgian population and often associated with symptomatology of related neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.
TUBA4A	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	The tubulin alpha 4a (TUBA4A) gene has been recently associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
TUBA4A	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	TUBA4A gene has recently been identified as a potential candidate amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS)-associated gene using exome-wide rare variant burden analysis.
Col25a1	Alzheimer's disease	Here we studied the physiological function of CLAC-P/collagen XXV, a transmembrane-type collagen originally identified as a component of senile plaque amyloid of Alzheimer's disease brains, by means of generating Col25a1-deficient (KO) mice.
COL25A1	Alzheimer's disease	Collagen XXV alpha 1 (COL25A1) is a collagenous type II transmembrane protein purified from senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains.
COL25A1	Alzheimer's disease	The COL25A1 gene, located in 4q25, encodes the CLAC protein, which has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis.
COL25A1	Alzheimer's disease	Thus, in addition to the biochemical data, there is now genetic evidence of association between COL25A1 and risk for Alzheimer's disease.

Hey1	colon cancer	This was associated with the decreased protein expression of Notch1, Notch2, Notch3 and Hey1, and the increased expression of the tumor suppressor microRNA (miR or miRNA)-200 family members (miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141 and miR-429) that are typically downregulated in colon cancer.
P-IGF	breast cancer	Phosphorylated IGF-IR/IR (P-IGF-IR/IR) and its downstream signaling partner phospho-S6 (P-S6) were evaluated immunohistochemically in tumor tissue microarrays representing 438 cases of invasive breast cancer.
P-IGF	breast cancer	Importantly, P-IGF-IR/IR was detected in all breast cancer subtypes (luminal, 48.1%; triple negative, 41.9%; and HER2, 64.3%).
P-IGF	breast cancer	Thus, we can determine which patients have the activated receptor and provide evidence that P-IGF-IR/IR is a prognostic factor for breast cancer.
P-IGF	breast cancer	Beyond this, P-IGF-IR/IR could be a predictive marker for response to IGF-IR and/or IR-targeted therapies, as these inhibitors may be of benefit in all breast cancer subtypes including those with acquired resistance to tamoxifen.

C5a	neutropenia	NDT 9513727 effectively inhibited C5a-induced neutropenia in gerbil and cynomolgus macaque in vivo.
C5a	neutropenia	Nonetheless, topical application of C5aR antagonists produced circulating levels of the drugs that antagonized the LPS-induced systemic responses of neutropenia and hypotension.
CD88	mastocytosis	Several of these antigens (CD2, CD25, CD35, CD88, CD203c) appear to be upregulated on MCs in patients with systemic mastocytosis and therefore are used as diagnostic markers.
CD88	mastocytosis	This study analysed the expression of various complement-related cell surface antigens (CD11b/CR3, CD11c/CR4, CD35/CR1, CD55/DAF, CD59/MIRL, CD88/C5aR) on bone marrow mast cells (BMMC) in patients suffering from systemic mastocytosis (SM), other haematological diseases and non-haematological disorders (control groups).

RASP	cancer	Previous studies have shown that N(1),N(12)-bis(all-trans-retinoyl)spermine (RASP), a retinoid analog, inhibits RNase P activity and angiogenesis in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane, demonstrates anti-tumor activity on prostate cancer cells, and acts as anti-inflammatory agent, being more effective and less toxic than all-trans retinoic acid.
RASP	cancer	These results suggest RASP, as a promising lead compound for the treatment of several dermatological disorders and certain cancer types, has apparently minimal toxic side-effects as revealed in this two-generation reproduction study in rats.
Hhat	cancer	To determine the functional significance of Hhat expression in breast cancer, we used a panel of breast cancer cell lines that included estrogen receptor (ER) positive, HER2 amplified, triple negative, and tamoxifen resistant cells.
Hhat	cancer	Depletion of Hhat decreased anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent proliferation of ER positive, but not triple negative, breast cancer cells.
Hhat	cancer	These data suggest that Hhat plays a critical role in ER positive, HER2 amplified, and hormone resistant breast cancer proliferation and highlights the potential promise of Hhat inhibitors for therapeutic benefit in breast cancer.
Hedgehog acyltransferase	cancer	Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT) is the enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum that palmitoylates Hedgehog proteins, is a member of a small subfamily of membrane-bound O-acyltransferase proteins that acylate secreted proteins, and is an important drug target in cancer.

StAR-related lipid transfer protein 3	breast cancer	To study how elevated StAR-related lipid transfer protein 3 (StARD3) expression affects breast cancer cells, we generated MCF-7 cells stably overexpressing StARD3-green fluorescent protein.
StARD3	breast cancer	In two Finnish nationwide patient cohorts, approximately 10% (212/2220) breast cancers exhibited high StARD3 protein levels, which was strongly associated with HER2 amplification; several factors related to poor disease outcome and poor breast cancer-specific survival.
StARD3	breast cancer	In addition, high StARD3 levels in breast cancers were associated with elevated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase mRNA levels and anti-Src-Tyr416 immunoreactivity.
StARD3	breast cancer	These results provide evidence that StARD3 overexpression results in increased cholesterol biosynthesis and Src kinase activity in breast cancer cells and suggest that elevated StARD3 expression may contribute to breast cancer aggressiveness by increasing membrane cholesterol and enhancing oncogenic signaling.
STARD3	breast cancer	In addition it will discuss the clinical and biological implications of the amplification of ten other genes at this locus (MED1, STARD3, GRB7, THRA, RARA, IGFPB4, CCR7, KRT20, KRT19 and GAST) in breast cancer.

MLN64	breast cancer	The metastatic lymph node 64 (MLN64) gene was initially identified as highly expressed in the metastatic lymph node from breast cancer.
MLN64	breast cancer	However, the role played by MLN64 in breast cancer remains unclear.
MLN64	breast cancer	In the present study, the expression of MLN64 was examined in a breast cancer cohort using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical staining.
MLN64	breast cancer	A panel of breast cancer cell sublines was subsequently developed by knockdown of MLN64 expression.
MLN64	breast cancer	In conclusion, MLN64 is overexpressed in breast cancer, and its level correlates with poor prognosis and patient survival.
MLN64	breast cancer	MLN64 contributes to the development and progression of breast cancer through the regulation of cell proliferation and adhesive capacity.
STARD3	breast cancer	STARD3 and RARA also hold clinical relevance, the former having been shown to function in steroidogenesis and therefore implicated in hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer.
STARD3	breast cancer	We used a genetic association study design to determine if common genetic variation (frequency&gt;or=5%) in a 400-kb region surrounding ERBB2 and containing the PPARBP, CRK7, NEUROD2, PPP1R1B, STARD3, TCAP, PNMT, CAB2, ERBB2, C17ORF37, GRB7 and ZNFN1A3 genes, was associated with breast cancer risk.
HEX	periodontitis	The applicability of salivary Beta -hexosaminidase (Beta-HEX A%, percentage of Beta-HEX A isoenzyme to total Beta-HEX) and Beta-HEX B% (Beta-HEX B/Beta-HEX) indexes was investigated as a possible marker of periodontitis.

Sprouty	cancer	Sprouty proteins are modulators of mitogeninduced signal transduction processes and therefore can influence the process of cancerogenesis.
Sprouty	cancer	The encoded protein of Sprouty homolog 4 (SPRY4) is associated with various human cancers.
SPRY1	rhabdoid tumor	We show that these retained super-enhancers are essential for rhabdoid tumor survival, including some that are shared by all subtypes, such as SPRY1, and other lineage-specific super-enhancers, such as SOX2 in brain-derived rhabdoid tumors.
Sprouty	cancer	As a member of the Sprouty family, Sprouty4 has been previously shown to function as a tumour suppressor in lung and breast cancer.

CypD	glucose intolerance	We previously found that global CypD knockout mice (KO) are protected from diet-induced glucose intolerance; however, the tissue-specific function of CypD and mPTP, particularly in the control of glucose homeostasis, has not been ascertained.
CypD	glucose intolerance	Mice lacking CypD were protected from high fat diet-induced glucose intolerance due to increased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle.
CypD	glucose intolerance	Adult CypD(-/-) developed hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance albeit resistant to DIO.
VWF	atrial fibrillation	von Willebrand factor (VWF) is an independent risk factor for adverse events in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF).
VWF	atrial fibrillation	Higher VWF level correlated with higher CHADS2 scores and with progressing intensity of blood stasis in the left atrium and thrombus formation in all three time periods of atrial fibrillation duration.
vWF	atrial fibrillation	Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) exhibit higher plasma vWF and lower ADAMTS13 levels.
PICALM	Alzheimer's disease	In a multicenter case-control association study, we studied the SNPs rs11136000 (clusterin, CLU), rs541458 (phosphatidylinositol binding clatrin assembly protein, PICALM), and rs1554948 (transcription factor A, and tyrosine kinase, non-receptor, 1, TNK1) according to the three age groups 50-65 years (group 1), 66-80 years (group 2), and 80+ years (group 3) in 569 older subjects without cognitive impairment (NoCI) and 520 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.
PICALM	Alzheimer's disease	To study the association of apolipoprotein E (APOE), Clusterin (CLU) and phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) polymorphisms in Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects compared to cognitively normal control subjects in an Indian population.
PICALM	Alzheimer's disease	Genome-wide association studies and meta-analyses implicated that increased risk of developing Alzheimer's diseases (AD) has been associated with the ABCA7, APOE, BIN1, CASS4, CD2AP, CD33, CELF1, CLU, CR1, DSG2, EPHA1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DRB4, INPP5D, MEF2C, MS4A4A, MS4A4E, MS4A6E, NME8, PICALM, PLD3, PTK2B, RIN3, SLC24A4, SORL1, and ZCWPW1 genes.
PICALM	Alzheimer's disease	The PICALM rs541458 T allele has been recognized as a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, and age might modulate the effects that genetic factors have on cognitive functions and brain.
PICALM	Alzheimer's disease	The association of variants in CLU, CR1, PICALM, BIN1, ABCA7, and CD33 genes with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) was evaluated and confirmed through genome-wide association study.
GDF-15	pancreatic cancer	In vivo, depletion of GDF-15 in Ras-driven tumor xenografts and in an orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer delayed tumor development.
GDF-15	pancreatic adenocarcinoma	Further, production of GDF-15 is directly regulated by NF-KB, and the colocalization of activated NF-KB and GDF-15 in epithelial ducts of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma supports the importance of this observation.
GDF-15	pancreatic cancer	The present study investigated the association between cancer-associated weight loss and plasma GDF-15 concentration, as well as other biomarkers, in patients with metastatic lung or exocrine pancreatic cancer.
GDF-15	pancreatic cancer	In pancreatic cancer patients, no association between GDF-15 levels and weight loss was identified.
MIC-1	pancreatic cancer	The aim of the present case-control study was to compare the diagnostic value of ULBP2, MIC-1 and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) in 359 serum samples, consisting of 152 cases of PC, 20 cases of pre-pancreatic cancer, 91 cases of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and 96 normal controls (NC).
MIC-1	pancreatic cancer	Macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 (MIC-1/GDF15) has been identified as a potential novel biomarker for detection of pancreatic cancer (PCa).

growth/differentiation factor 15	pancreatic cancer	CD30 ligand/TNFSF8, chordin-like 2, FGF-10/KGF-2, growth/differentiation factor 15, I-TAC/CXCL11, OSM, and SCF might represent as predictive biomarkers for gemcitabine and erlotinib response of patients with pancreatic cancer.
notch	pneumonia	Radiologists evaluated following CT findings: maximum tumor diameter, percentage of solid component (%solid), air bronchogram, spiculation, adjacency of bullae or interstitial pneumonia (IP) around the tumor, notch, and pleural indent.
notch	pneumonia	The results strongly suggest that electronic self-auscultation at a single location (suprasternal notch) can support diagnosis of pneumonia in patients with COPD.
DDH	Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease	We compared patients who underwent PAO for the treatment of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease hip dysplasia (CMTHD group) with patients who underwent PAO for treatment of hip dysplasia secondary to DDH in terms of (1) modified Harris Hip scores; (2) radiographic correction of acetabular dysplasia; and (3) the rate of complications.
DDH	Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease	Twenty-seven subjects with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease who underwent a PAO between January 1991 and December 2010 were matched to 54 subjects with DDH on the basis of sex, age, date of surgery, and body mass index.
DDH	neuromuscular disease	The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of the Dega osteotomy in the treatment of hip pathology resulting from both developmental dysplasia (DDH) and neuromuscular disease (NM).
DDH	neuromuscular disease	Neuromuscular dysplasia of the hip (NDH) is a sequel of neuromuscular disease, and generally presents later in childhood than DDH.
DDH	neuromuscular disease	To explore this suggestion we ascertained the presence of neuromuscular disease within a cohort of DDH patients, and asked whether the neuromuscular condition is the initial etiology of the dysplasia or a coincidental finding.
DDH	neuromuscular syndrome	We examined 45 infants with nondevelopmental dysplasia of the hip (non-DDH), including congenital deficiency of the femur (CDF) (20 infants), neuromuscular syndrome (five infants), skeletal dysplasia (15 infants), and infection (five infants), and present the sonographic findings.
RHBDD2	colorectal cancer	In previous studies, we demonstrated that human RHBDD2 is over-expressed in the advanced stages of breast and colorectal cancers, suggesting a favorable role in cell proliferation.
Rhbdd2	cancer	So far little is known about the expression of RHBDD2 in other tissues and other species, and because of similarities between cancer and embryonic cells, this study focused on the evaluation of Rhbdd2 expression in embryonic and adult rat tissues.
RHBDD2	breast cancer	Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed a significant RHBDD2 mRNA overexpression in advanced breast cancer compared with normal tissue samples (p = 0.012).
RHBDD2	breast cancer	Immunohistochemistry analysis showed a significant increase of RHBDD2 protein expression in association with breast cancer samples negative for progesterone receptor (p = 0.015).
RHBDD2	breast cancer	Rhomboid domain containing 2 (RHBDD2) was previously observed overexpressed and amplified in breast cancer samples.
RHBDD2	breast cancer	In order to identify biological pathways modulated by RHBDD2, gene expression profiles of RHBDD2 silenced breast cancer cells were analyzed using whole genome human microarray.
RHBDD2	breast cancer	We used a lentivirus-based approach for stable silencing of RHBDD2 mRNA in the T47D breast cancer cell line, and we examined the transcriptional consequences on UPR genes as well as the phenotypic effects on migration and proliferation processes.
RHBDD2	breast cancer	Based on these studies, we hypothesize that RHBDD2 overexpression in breast cancer could represent an adaptive phenotype to the stressful tumor microenvironment by modulating the ER stress response.
RHBDD2	breast cancer	In previous studies, we identified rhomboid domain containing 2 (RHBDD2) gene to be markedly overexpressed in breast cancer patients that developed recurrence of the disease.
RHBDD2	colorectal cancer	In this study, we evaluated for the first time RHBDD2 gene expression in colorectal cancer (CRC).
RHBDD2	colorectal cancer	Overall, these results showed that RHBDD2 overexpression might play a role in colorectal cancer progression.
RHBDD2	breast cancer	In the course of breast cancer global gene expression studies, we identified an uncharacterized gene known as RHBDD2 (Rhomboid domain containing 2) to be markedly over-expressed in primary tumors from patients with recurrent disease.
RHBDD2	breast cancer	Western-blot, RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing analyses allowed us to identify two RHBDD2 alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms expressed in breast cancer cell lines.
RHBDD2	breast cancer	Interestingly, siRNA-mediated silencing of RHBDD2 expression results in a decrease of MCF7 breast cancer cells proliferation compared with the corresponding controls (p=0.001).
RHBDD2	breast cancer	In conclusion, our findings suggest that RHBDD2 over-expression behaves as an indicator of poor prognosis and may play a role facilitating breast cancer progression.
Akt	VSD	These effects could also be exerted via the upregulation of eight specific target genes, the subsequent over-activation of the PKC and PI3 K-Akt pathways, and the eventual abnormal cardiac development and VSD.
CEBPA	asthma	Reduced translation of CEBPA mRNA has been associated with increased proliferation of bronchial smooth muscle (BSM) cells of asthma patients.
CEBPA	asthma	HDM extract reduced the C/EBPAlfa expression in BSM cells of asthma patients, which coincided with significantly increased levels of calreticulin (CRT) protein, an inhibitor of CEBPA mRNA translation.
CEBPA	asthma	In conclusion, HDM extract reduced CEBPA mRNA translation, specifically in asthmatic BSM cells, and 1) upregulated CRT, 2) activated PAR2, and increased 3) IL-6 expression and 4) the proliferation of asthmatic BSM cells.
C/EBP-alpha	asthma	Airway smooth muscle cells from persons with asthma are deficient in C/EBP-alpha, which may explain the finding that CSs do not inhibit the proliferation of these cells in vitro.
C/EBPalpha	asthma	CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) control cell proliferation; lack of C/EBPalpha correlates with increased proliferation of bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMCs) of asthmatic patients.
C/EBPalpha	asthma	Expression and function of C/EBPalpha, beta, delta, and epsilon BSMCs of control subjects (n = 9), asthmatic patients (n = 12), and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; n = 10) were determined.
C/EBPalpha	asthma	The asthmatic group did not appropriately express C/EBPalpha.
C/EBPalpha	asthma	Protein analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed the disease-specific expression pattern of C/EBPalpha in asthmatic patients and C/EBPdelta in patients with COPD.
C/EBP-alpha	asthma	The reason for the differences which have been observed in the in vitro properties of airway smooth muscle derived from asthmatic individuals may result from an inherent "supercontractility", an increased tendency to proliferate due to the absence of an inhibitory transcription factor C/EBP-alpha, the influence of an altered extracellular matrix and/or a decrease in release of factors such as PGE(2) which would under normal circumstances inhibit both proliferation and contraction.
miR-152	Hepatocellular carcinoma	Hepatocellular carcinoma etiology had no detectable influence on miR-122 expression, whereas miR-152 was increased in HCV+ tissue samples.
miR-152	hepatocellular carcinoma	Aberrant expressions of the miR-148/152 family (miR-148a, miR-148b, and miR-152) have been documented in many tumor tissues, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
miR-152	hepatocellular carcinoma	And high expression of HLA-G further suppressed NK against cancer cells, providing a new concept that miR-152 was involved in HBV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma.
ND2	Medulloblastoma	Further, FDA-approved arsenic trioxide (ATO) and the ND2-SmoA1 mouse model of Medulloblastoma (MB) were used to extend our analyses of combined MRI and Reverse Phase Protein Microarray (RPMA) data to assess tumor responses to ATO and to uncover the complexity of therapeutic molecular biology.
ND2	medulloblastoma	Importantly, while ASC deficiency did not affect normal cerebellar development, ASC knockout mice on the Smoothened (ND2:SmoA1) transgenic model of medulloblastoma exhibited a profound reduction in medulloblastoma incidence and a delayed tumor onset.

HspBP1	neurodegenerative disease	Our findings indicate a critical role of HspBP1 in differential CHIP/Hsp70 activities in neuronal and glial cells and the greater neuronal vulnerability to misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases.
HSP70 interacting protein	Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy	In this study the adenoviral mediated over-expression of HSP70 interacting protein (HIP) alone was shown to significantly reduce inclusion formation in both an in vitro model of Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy and a primary neuronal model of polyglutamine disease.

CD80	candidiasis	A population of CD80+Gr-1+ myeloid cells was found to be expanded in conventional as well as in bone marrow-transplanted mice with disseminated candidiasis, but its depletion increased the IFN-gamma-mediated antifungal resistance.
CD8 0	esophageal candidiasis	The patients with esophageal candidiasis had lower CD4+ cell counts (129/microliter) and CD4:CD8 ratios (0.23) than those with oropharyngeal candidiasis (CD4 179/microliter; CD4:CD8 0.35).
g fat	cystic fibrosis	We served patients with cystic fibrosis (CF, n=29), cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD, n=19) and healthy controls (n=18) a standardized breakfast (23 g protein, 25 g fat and 76 g carbohydrates) after an overnight fasting.

lobar holoprosencephaly	spina bifida	Acrania, alobar holoprosencephaly, cephaloceles, and spina bifida can confidently be diagnosed at that stage and should actively be looked for in every fetus undergoing first-trimester ultrasound.
semilobar holoprosencephaly	myelomeningocele	We present a new case with 13q deletion syndrome phenotypically characterized by severe major malformations, some of them still undescribed, consisting of left diaphragmatic hernia, right pulmonary sequestration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pancreatic agenesis, polysplenia, and catastrophic central nervous system malformations: semilobar holoprosencephaly, occipital myelomeningocele, partial agenesis of the corpus callosum and agenesis of olfactory bulbs.
lobar holoprosencephaly	spina bifida	The early scan detected all cases of acrania, alobar holoprosencephaly, exomphalos, gastroschisis, megacystis and body stalk anomaly, 77% of absent hand or foot, 50% of diaphragmatic hernia, 50% of lethal skeletal dysplasias, 60% of polydactyly, 34% of major cardiac defects, 5% of facial clefts and 14% of open spina bifida, but none of agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar or vermian hypoplasia, echogenic lung lesions, bowel obstruction, most renal defects or talipes.
semilobar holoprosencephaly	myelomeningocele	The case presented is, to our knowledge, the first published report comprising a combination of a semilobar holoprosencephaly associated with a Chiari II malformation and a myelomeningocele diagnosed prenatally and confirmed by postmortem neuropathologic evaluation.
semilobar holoprosencephaly	myelomeningocele	These findings indicate that in the case of pre- and postnatal detection of a myelomeningocele and/or Chiari II malformation, possible additional intracranial malformation, such as a semilobar holoprosencephaly, should also be taken into account and vice versa.
lobar holoprosencephaly	spina bifida	We report on a female still-birth with cebocephaly, alobar holoprosencephaly, cleft palate, lumbar spina bifida, sirenomelia, a single umbilical artery, and a 46,XX karyotype, but without maternal diabetes mellitus.
FGFR1	hepatocellular carcinoma	The current study provides novel evidence that TGFBeta upregulates the expression of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including IGF1R, EGFR, PDGFBetaR, and FGFR1 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.
CD1d	rheumatoid arthritis	While numerical and functional defects of invariant NKT cells have been demonstrated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the detailed characterization of proliferative and secretory responses following CD1d-mediated presentation is lacking; the presence of non-invariant populations has never been assessed in human autoimmunity.
Ang-2	obesity	In adults, angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and its soluble receptor (sTie-2) are associated with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity and could be increased in children with OSA and obesity, particularly those with evidence of cardiometabolic alterations.
Ang-2	obesity	Children with obesity and OSA had significantly elevated plasma Ang-2 and sTie-2 levels compared to corresponding controls with and without obesity.
Ang-2	obesity	Ang-2 and sTie-2 plasma levels are increased in pediatric OSA and obesity, particularly when endothelial dysfunction or insulin resistance is detectable, and appear to decrease upon OSA treatment.
ANG-2	obesity	ANG-2 overexpressing mice show increased sWAT vascularization and are resistant to HFD-induced obesity.
angiopoietin-2	morbid obesity	We studied the effect of sleeve gastrectomy and the influence of FTO rs9930506 polymorphism on Tie-2, angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 expression in morbid obesity.
G-alpha	pseudohypoparathyroidism	Those most at risk report a family history of at least one parent with a pre-existing G-alpha protein defect, including night blindness, pseudohypoparathyroidism or adenoma of the thyroid or pituitary gland.
AR	adenocarcinoma	We have previously shown that the ethanol extract of dried Angelica gigas Nakai (AGN) root exerts anticancer activity against androgen receptor (AR)-negative human DU145 and PC-3 prostate cancer xenografts and primary carcinogenesis in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model.
AR	adenocarcinoma	We showed previously that nuclear localization of the androgen receptor (AR) and expression of the androgen-responsive gene FK506-binding protein 5 (FKBP5) in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) tissues were associated with decreased patient survival, suggesting a role for androgens in this cancer.
AR	adenocarcinoma	Only 5 samples were ERG-/AR- corresponding to adenocarcinoma GS of 6.
AR	serous carcinoma	AR was expressed by 54% (27/50) of ECA including 60% of low grade endometrioid carcinomas, 70% high grade endometrioid carcinomas, 70% serous carcinomas, 50% carcinosarcomas, and 20% clear cell carcinomas.
AR	serous carcinoma	High AR expression was chiefly restricted to a subset of serous carcinomas (50%).
AR	serous carcinoma	AR expression occurred most often in concert with ER staining, although 5 high grade cancers (1 serous carcinoma, 4 carcinosarcomas) showed AR expression in the absence of ER.
AR	serous carcinoma	In summary, AR positivity is seen in over half of ECA in our study, including the majority of low grade endometrioid carcinomas, high grade endometrioid carcinomas, and serous carcinomas.
AR	serous carcinoma	High level expression is seen in half of serous carcinomas and a subset of serous carcinomas and carcinosarcomas show some degree of AR staining in the absence of ER, suggesting a possible role for androgen inhibition in treatment of these cases.
CD166	osteoarthritis	IL-6 and the MSC markers CD166 and nestin were colocalized in macroscopically normal human cartilage taken from the lateral femoral compartment of knees with medial tibiofemoral osteoarthritis.
SOD2	diabetes	In conclusion, our findings support a model where Sirt3 plays a protective role against oxidative stress in oocytes exposed to maternal diabetes through deacetylating SOD2K68.
MNSOD	dyslipidemia	The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of LPL (rs320), LIPC (rs2070895), SCARB1 (rs5888), LCAT (rs2292318), CETP (rs708272), ADIPOQ (rs1501299), RETN (rs3745367), PON1 (rs662), and MNSOD (rs4880) gene polymorphisms on lipid metabolism and diabetic dyslipidemia.
MNSOD	dyslipidemia	Significant associations were observed between LPL (rs320) (p&lt;0.001), LIPC (rs2070895) (p&lt;0.001), SCARB1 (rs5888) (p&lt;0.001), LCAT (rs2292318) (p&lt;0.001), CETP (rs708272) (p&lt;0.001), ADIPOQ (rs1501299) (p=0.01), RETN (rs3745367) (p&lt;0.001), and MNSOD (rs4880) (p&lt;0.001) polymorphisms and diabetic dyslipidemia.
MNSOD	dyslipidemia	LPL (rs320), LIPC (rs2070895), SCARB1 (rs5888), LCAT (rs2292318), CETP (rs708272), ADIPOQ (rs1501299), RETN (rs3745367), and MNSOD (rs4880) polymorphisms play an important role in basic molecular metabolism in diabetic dyslipidemia.
YKL-40	asbestosis	We studied if YKL-40 is related to inflammation, fibrosis, and/or lung function in subjects exposed to asbestosis.
YKL-40	asbestosis	Plasma YKL-40 levels were significantly higher in subjects with asbestosis (n = 19) than in those with no fibrotic findings in HRCT following asbestos exposure (n = 66) or in unexposed healthy controls.
YKL-40	siderosis	YKL-40 is a promising marker of cardiovascular disease and liver siderosis in Beta-TM patients.
YKL-40	siderosis	The aim of the study was to analyse the level of serum YKL-40 and plasma chitotriosidase activity of patients with beta-thalassemia to assess whether their expression correlates with liver disease and degree of liver siderosis.
Slit2	Invasive ductal carcinoma	Our results demonstrated that (1) Invasive ductal carcinoma patients with low expression of Slit2 or Robo1 exhibited worse prognosis and brain-specific metastasis, but not liver, bone or lung.
SLIT2	invasive ductal carcinoma	Ten prognostic and diagnostic epigenetic breast cancer biomarkers (PITX2, RASSF1A, PLAU, LHX3, PITX3, LIMK1, SLITRK1, SLIT2, HS3ST2, and TFF1) were analyzed in tissue samples obtained from two patients with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast.
Slit2	invasive ductal carcinoma	The aim of this study is to determine the correlation between methylation status of multiple cancer genes, p16(INK4A), p14(ARF), Cyclin D2 and Slit2 in invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and paired serum DNA and clinicopathological parameters.
IRS2	allergic disease	To examine the role of IRS2 in allergic disease, we evaluated the responses of IRS2-deficient (IRS2(-/-)) mice.
CDK6	medulloblastoma	Additional work further confirmed CDK6, RICTOR, and CTSB (cathepsin B) as targets of miR-218 and examined the functional role of one of these targets, CDK6, in medulloblastoma.
CDK6	medulloblastoma	Overexpression of CDK6 is present in approximately one-third of medulloblastomas and is an independent poor prognostic marker for this disease.
CDK6	medulloblastoma	MicroRNA (miR)-124 inhibits expression of CDK6 and prevents proliferation of glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells in vitro.
CDK6	medulloblastoma	We examined the effects of miR-124 overexpression on medulloblastoma cells both in vitro and in vivo and compared cell lines that have low and high CDK6 expression.
CDK6	medulloblastoma	MiR-124 overexpression inhibits the proliferation of medulloblastoma cells, and this effect is mediated mostly through the action of miR-124 upon CDK6.
CDK6	medulloblastoma	CDK6 is overexpressed in medulloblastoma patients and is associated with an adverse prognosis.
CDK6	medulloblastoma	To investigate the role of CDK6 in medulloblastoma, we assayed the effect of CDK6 inhibition on proliferation by depleting expression with RNA interference (RNAi) or by inhibiting kinase function with a small molecule inhibitor, PD0332991.
CDK6	medulloblastoma	Gene expression analysis revealed that CDK6 mRNA expression is higher than normal cerebellum in fifteen out of sixteen medulloblastoma patient samples.
CDK6	medulloblastoma	Inhibition of CDK6 by RNAi significantly decreased medulloblastoma cell proliferation and colony forming potential.
CDK6	medulloblastoma	Our findings suggest that targeting CDK6 with small molecule inhibitors may prove beneficial in the treatment of medulloblastoma, especially when combined with radiation.
involucrin	fibroma	In trichoblastic fibroma (three cases), CK1/5/10/14, CK7, CK8/18, CK10/11, CK14, CK17 and CK19 were expressed in the basaloid nests, and CK6 and involucrin were detected in the inner layers of keratinous cysts.
4- to 5	type 1 diabetes mellitus	Since type 1 diabetes mellitus often begins in childhood, we used juvenile (4- to 5-wk-old) rats to demonstrate that a single bout of IIH (5 U/kg sc) reduced plasma glucose by 24% and peak epinephrine by 59% 1 day later.
DCIP	IDDM	Plasma membrane NADH oxidoreductase activity, studied using cytosolic NADH as substrate and assayed with DCIP as acceptor, was significantly increased in IDDM patients, suggesting a response to a deficient mitochondrial energetic activity.
4 to 3	IDDM	Non insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) mortality is 1.4 to 3.7 times that of non-diabetics.
eCO	asthma	In the COPD and asthma patients, the median urinary cotinine concentration was 167 ng/mL (range, 2-5,348 ng/mL) and 47 ng/mL (range, 5-2,735 ng/mL), respectively (p &lt; 0.0001), whereas the median eCO level was 8 ppm (range, 0-31 ppm) and 5 ppm (range, 2-45 ppm), respectively (p &lt; 0.05).
eCO	asthma	In 30 (29%) of the patients with asthma or COPD, the urinary cotinine concentration and the eCO level both belied the patient claims of not being current smokers.
eCO	asthma	We aimed to study eCO levels in asthmatics and detect the possible factors influencing them.
eCO	Asthma	The differences in eCO levels among various asthmatic phenotypes and the correlations between eCO and other measured parameters (spirometric indices, Asthma Control Test score, exhaled nitric oxide, total IgE, blood eosinophils and marker of oxidative damage of proteins) were analysed.
eCO	asthma	Levels of eCO widely differed according to the selected characteristics of asthma.
eCO	Asthma	Asthmatics showed higher eCO concentrations than controls (1.44 +/- 0.12 ppm vs. 0.91 +/- 0.11 ppm, p &lt; 0.001).
eCO	asthma	Acute exacerbation of asthma was accompanied by a significant increase in eCO compared to the clinically controlled stage (2.17 +/- 0.36 ppm vs. 1.33 +/- 0.13 ppm, p &lt; 0.001).
eCO	asthma	Atopic, non-atopic asthma and asthma associated with allergic rhinitis (AR) showed elevated levels of eCO.
eCO	asthma	The levels of eCO negatively correlated with the marker of protein oxidation in asthmatics, especially in atopic form and during acute exacerbation.
eCO	asthma	In a population of asthmatic children, eCO levels could be considered as a marker of both allergic inflammation and oxidative stress in the airways.
eCO	asthma	Concomitant AR and asthma control were the most important factors affecting the levels of eCO in asthmatic children.
eCO	asthma	eCO values have been evaluated as potential indicators of inflammation in asthma, stable COPD and exacerbations, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, or during surgery or critical care.
eCO	bronchial hyperreactivity	Twenty-four non-smokers (10 male, 14 female, mean age 17.6 years) and 24 smokers (mean of 3.5 pack-years; 15 male, 9 female, mean age 17.8 years) were compared in terms of lung function, bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR), levels of exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO), exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), and blood counts.
eCO	asthma	The concentration of exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) in young children with stable asthma and during acute asthma attack is not known.
eCO	asthma	In preschool-age children, eCO levels of those with asthma attacks (mean +/- SE, 2.7 +/- 0.3 p.p.m., n= 43) were significantly higher than those of subjects with asymptomatic asthma (0.5 +/- 0.1 p.p.m., P &lt; 0.05), URI (0.8 +/- 0.1 p.p.m., P &lt; 0.05) and healthy children (0.4 +/- 0.1 p.p.m., P &lt; 0.05).
eCO	asthma	A multivariate linear regression model showed that eCO was higher in children with asthma attacks independent of age and gender.
eCO	asthma	In 33 asthmatic children followed before and after treatment, eCO levels during asthma attacks significantly decreased after inhalation therapy with a combination of salbutamol and sodium cromoglycate (before therapy, 2.9 +/- 0.4 p.p.m.
eCO	asthma	The measurement of eCO using a novel collecting system is useful in the recognition of asthma in preschool children.
E-CO	asthma	Elevations in E-CO have been observed in critically ill or post-surgical patients and those with various pulmonary diseases associated with inflammation, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cystic fibrosis and infections.
eCO	asthma	The purpose of this meta-analysis is to determine whether eCO is elevated in asthmatics, is regulated by steroid treatment and reflects disease severity and control.
eCO	asthma	Observational studies comparing eCO in non-smoking asthmatics and healthy subjects or asthmatics before and after steroid treatment were included.
eCO	asthma	The eCO level was significantly higher in asthmatics as compared to healthy subjects and in intermittent asthma as compared to persistent asthma.
eCO	asthma	However, eCO could not distinguish between steroid-treated asthmatics and steroid-free patients nor separate controlled and partly-controlled asthma from uncontrolled asthma in cross-sectional studies.
eCO	asthma	eCO is elevated in asthmatics but levels only partially reflect disease severity and control.
eCO	asthma	eCO might be a potentially useful non-invasive biomarker of airway inflammation and oxidative stress in nonsmoking asthmatics.
SphK2	arthritis	However, recent studies revealed that genetic inhibition of SphK2 did not significantly impact the severity or progression of inflammatory arthritis, while pharmacologic inhibition of SphK2 led to significantly more severe arthritis.
SphK2	arthritis	Therefore, SphK2 plays a controversial role in arthritis.
SphK2	arthritis	A specific SphK2 inhibitor inhibited inflammatory arthritis in one model, while siRNA knockdown of SphK2 worsened arthritis in another.
SphK2	arthritis	To investigate the role of SphK2 in TNF-Alfa-induced arthritis, we developed SphK2 deficient hTNF-Alfa overexpressing mice and separately treated hTNF-Alfa mice with ABC294640, a SphK2-specific inhibitor.
SphK2	arthritis	Our data show that genetic inhibition of SphK2 did not significantly impact the severity or progression of inflammatory arthritis, while pharmacologic inhibition of SphK2 led to significantly more severe arthritis.
SphK2	arthritis	In this study, we examined the role of SphK1 and SphK2 in a murine collagen-induced arthritis model by down-regulating each isoenzyme via specific small interfering RNA (siRNA).
SphK2	arthritis	Together, these results demonstrate the distinct immunomodulatory roles of SphK1 and SphK2 in the development of inflammatory arthritis by regulating the release of proinflammatory cytokines and T cell responses.
BA46	autism	Prefrontal Brodmann Areas (BA) BA46, BA47, and BA9 in autism and age-matched controls were analyzed by blinded researchers.
BA46	autism	We show that the number of parvalbumin+ interneurons in these 3 cortical areas-BA46, BA47, and BA9-is significantly reduced in autism compared with controls.
BA46	autism	These fetal structures generate regions with abnormal activity in autism, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA46), the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal cortex and the fusiform gyrus.
S100A12	tuberculoid leprosy	At the site of disease in leprosy, we found that S100A12 was more strongly expressed in skin lesions from tuberculoid leprosy (T-lep), the self-limiting form of the disease, compared to lepromatous leprosy (L-lep), the progressive form of the disease.
ET-1	pulmonary embolism	The aim of this study was to predict right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) using plasma concentration of D-dimer, pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and cardiac troponin I (TNI) in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE).
ET-1	pulmonary embolism	Atrial natriuretic petide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) may reflect the severity of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) in patients with pulmonary embolism (PE).
ET-1	pulmonary embolism	Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening disease, and several vasoconstrictors, including endothelin-1 (ET-1), play a key role in vasoconstriction and hypoxemia during the development of PE.
RERE	DRPLA	Impaired repression of cone-specific genes by the corepressors atrophin-1 (dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy [DRPLA] gene product) and atrophin-2 (arginine-glutamic acid dipeptide repeat [RERE] protein) appeared to be a molecular mechanism mediating the beneficial effect of the p.R311Q mutation.
RERE	DRPLA	RE repeats encoded (RERE) was identified recently as a protein with high homology to the atrophin-1 protein, which appears to be causal in the hereditary neurodegenerative disorder termed dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) caused by an abnormal glutamine expansion.
RERE	DRPLA	The gene isolated, designated RERE, has an open reading frame of 1566 amino acids, of which the C-terminal portion has 67% homology to DRPLA, whereas the N-terminal portion is distinctive.
RERE	DRPLA	Immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays demonstrate that the DRPLA and RERE proteins bind each other, for which one of the RE repeats has a primary role, and extended polyglutamine enhances the binding.
RERE	DRPLA	Moreover, when RERE is overexpressed, the distribution of endogenous DRPLA protein alters from the diffused to the speckled pattern in the nucleus so as to co-localize with RERE.
RERE	DRPLA	More RERE protein is recruited into nuclear aggregates of the DRPLA protein with extended polyglutamine than into those of pure polyglutamine.
DNB1	DRPLA	The DNB1/ARPh gene, which was found to be ubiquitously expressed in human adult and fetal tissues, is highly related to the DRPLA gene, in which expansion of a CAG triplet appears to be causal in the dentatorubral and pallidolysian atrophy disease phenotype.
CSNK2A1	breast carcinoma	Therefore, we evaluated the roles of CSNK2A1, SIRT6, and phosphorylated SIRT6 and their relationships in breast carcinoma.
CSNK2A1	breast carcinoma	This study demonstrates that CSNK2A1 and SIRT6 are indicators of poor prognosis for breast carcinomas and that CSNK2A1-mediated phosphorylation of SIRT6 might be involved in the progression of breast carcinoma.
CSNK2A1	breast cancer	RNA expression levels of CDC2L1, CDC2L2, CCNL1, CCNL2, CSNK2A1, CSNK2A2, and CSNK2B genes in breast cancer subtypes were analyzed.
CKII	breast cancer	Recent evidence suggests the role of Wnt signaling in human breast cancer involves elevated levels of nuclear and/or cytoplasmic beta-catenin using immunohistochemistry, overexpression or downregulation of specific Wnt proteins, overexpression of CKII and sFRP4, downregulation of WIF-1 and sFRP1, as well as amplification of DVL-1.
CHRM2	Cancer	By combining the mutational data in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and the spatial information in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), SpacePAC is able to identify novel mutation clusters in many proteins such as FGFR3 and CHRM2.
HM 2	fibrosarcoma	Colorectal cancer (HCT 116, LoVo, C 170 HM 2, CaCO-2), fibroblast (46-BR.IGI, CCD-18 Co) and fibrosarcoma (HT1080) cell lines were irradiated at 4 gray (4 Gy) and matrix metalloproteinase gene and protein expression examined over a 96 h period by real time polymerase chain reaction and gelatin zymography.
Hm2	HBL	In addition, because HBL is a major enterotoxin, we also designed HBL gene-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, i.e., Hm1 and Hm2, that generated the same results as those of the hemolysis and BCET-RPLA assays.
Hm2	HBL	Primers B16S1/B16S2 and Hm1/Hm2 could be combined into a multiplex PCR system for the simultaneous detection of B. cereus group cells and the possible presence of their HBL enterotoxins.
hm2	cancer	Positive cancer invasion in the cut end was classified as hm2 or dm2 in 8 patients and em2 in 13.
FGF5	Kaposi's sarcoma	Biopsy samples from five acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-Kaposi's sarcomas and one non-AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma were assayed by in situ RNA hybridization onto paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin sections for the presence of two fibroblast growth factor gene transcripts, FGFB and FGF5.
FGF5	Kaposi's sarcoma	FGF5 gene expression was detected in the characteristic Kaposi's sarcoma spindle-shaped cells in the five samples from human immunodeficiency-positive (HIV+) patients.
FGF5	Kaposi's sarcoma	Furthermore, they demonstrate a contrasting expression pattern of FGF5 and FGFB genes, both involved in the growth factor pathogenic cascade leading to Kaposi's sarcoma.
LZ-M	Alzheimer's disease	Objective To explore the efficacy of ganoderma lucidum preparation(Ling Zhi) in treating APP/PS-1 transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease(AD).Methods APP/PS-1 transgenic mice of 4 months were randomly divided into model group,ganoderma lucidum treatment groups,including high [2250 mg/(kg*d)] and middle [750 mg/(kg*d)] dose groups,i.e.LZ-H and LZ-M groups,and the positive control group(treated with donepezil hydrochloride [2 mg/(kg*d)]).In addition,C57BL/6J wild mice were selected as normal group.The animals were administered for 4 months.Histopathological examinations including hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining,immunohistochemistry,special staining,and electron microscopy were applied,and then the pathological morphology and structures in different groups were compared.
Lyz	SBMA	For the hydrogel prepared using the comonomer mixture with 5.0 wt % SBMA, the amount of adsorbed Lyz is 0.91 myg/cm2, which corresponds to only 56.8% of the amount adsorbed on EASY DAY(R) SCLs.
LZ-M	Alzheimer's disease	Objective To evaluate the efficacy of Ganoderma lucidum preparation on the behaviors,biochemistry,and autoimmunity parameters of mouse models of APP/PS-1 double transgenic Alzheimer's disease(AD).Methods A total of 44 4-month-old APP/PS-1 double transgenic AD mice were randomly divided into AD model group,Aricept group,Ganoderma lucidum middle-dose(LZ-M)group,and Ganoderma lucidum high-dose(LZ-H)group,with 11 mice in each group.In addition,10 4-month-old C57BL/6 mice were used as the control group.Water maze test was conducted to observe the behavior changes,and the protein expressions in brain tissues were detected by Western blot analysis.The autoimmune indicators were detected by indirect immunofluorescence method.Results In the navigation experiment,the time of finding the platform was gradually shortened since the 2nd day in the control,LZ-H,and LZ-M groups,and the time of searching the platform in the AD model group gradually increased.On the 5th day,the time of finding platform was significantly shorter in control group (t=5.607,P=0.000) and LZ-H group(t=2.750,P=0.010)than AD model group.In the space exploration experiment,the number of crossing the target platform(t=2.452,P=0.025)and the residence time in the target quadrant(t=2.530,P=0.020)in AD model group mice was significantly smaller/shorter than those in control group;in addition,the number of crossing the target platform in the AD model group was significantly smaller than that in LZ-H group(t=2.317,P=0.030)and LZ-M group(t=2.443,P=0.030),while the residence time in target quadrant decreased significantly(t=2.770,P=0.020)compared with LZ-H group;the number of crossing through the target platform quadrant(t=2.493,P=0.022)and residence time in the target quadrant(t=2.683,P=0.015)in LZ-H group were significantly higher than in Aricept group.Western blot analysis showed that the expression of ApoA1 in the brain tissues of mice in LZ-H and LZ-M groups were significantly higher than those in AD model group(P&lt;0.01,P&lt;0.05);ABeta-40 expression in LZ-H group was significantly lower than that in AD model group(P&lt;0.05);the expressions of Syt1,ApoE,and ABCA1 in brain tissues of mice in LZ-H group were significantly higher than those in model group(P&lt;0.01,P&lt;0.05).The plasma IgG level in Aricept group(t=30.945,P=0.000),LZ-M group(t=25.639,P=0.000)and LZ-H group(t=4.689,P=0.001)were significantly higher than that in the control group.Conclusion Ganoderma lucidum preparation can improve behavior disorders of AD model mice,promote the expressions of ApoA1,ApoE and Syt1,inhibit the expression of ABeta-40 protein,and improve the autoimmune function.
BRAF	colorectal cancer	Somatic v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutation, present in approximately 10% of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) cases, is associated with poor prognosis.
BRAF	colorectal cancer	All colorectal cancer patients tested for BRAF mutation, from October 2010 to November 2014 were identified.
v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1	colorectal cancer	The prognostic role of the V600E mutation of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is well established, but the therapeutic regimen targeting this disease is lacking.
BRAF	colorectal cancer	The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in metastatic colorectal cancer patients receiving first line oxaliplatin based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab and to evaluate their prognostic and predictive significance.
V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B	colorectal cancer	Activating BRAF (V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B) mutations occur in approximately 5% to 10% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, mostly V600E mutation, and it is associated with distinct clinical and pathological features.
BRAF	colorectal cancer	This review aims to provide data about new strategies to target to BRAF gene mutation in metastatic colorectal cancer.
prothrombin	autoimmune hepatitis	The variables of age, incidence of autoimmune hepatitis, model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, values for total bilirubin and prothrombin time-international ratio (PT-INR), and Japan Hepatic Encephalopathy Prediction Model (JHEPM) probability at registration were significantly higher in ALF patients than in ALI patients.
prothrombin	Autoimmune Hepatitis	On the other hand, the multivariate Cox proportional hazard model showed that positivity for serum anti-PD-1 antibody, probable diagnosis based on the revised scoring system proposed by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group, and prothrombin activity of less than 60% were associated with the later normalization of serum transaminase levels.
MPC-1	myeloma	Myeloma cell maturity was classified via immunophenotyping: myeloma cells showing mature plasma cell 1 (MPC-1)-positive and CD49e-positive cells were considered mature type; MPC-1-positive and CD49e-negative cells were considered intermediate type; and MPC-1-negative cells were considered immature type.
MPC-1	myeloma	The findings of this study demonstrate the clinical importance of myeloma cell classification according to immunophenotyping using MPC-1 and CD49e antibodies to determine patient prognosis in this era of novel therapeutic agents.
MPC-1	plasmacytoma	On the basis of biopsies of the masses in the pharynx and finger, he was diagnosed with extramedullary plasmablastic plasmacytoma, with somewhat immature CD45(+), MPC-1(-), and CD49e(-).
MPC-1	plasmacytoma	Changes to CD45 negativity and MPC-1 partial positivity were seen, while CD49e negativity persisted, suggesting that the plasmablastic plasmacytoma had reverted to a more immature state.
MPC1	extramedullary plasmacytoma	He had the following poor prognostic factors: 1) multiple extramedullary plasmacytomas, 2) massive myelomatous effusion, 3) increasing immature myeloma cells with plasmablastic morphology, and 4) predominance of MPC1-CD49e-CD45+ phenotype immature myeloma cells.
MPC-1	myeloma	CD32 was significantly expressed on primary myeloma cells, but immature, MPC-1- myeloma cells expressed CD32 more weakly than mature, MPC-1+ cells.
MPC-1	myeloma	Treatment with anti-CD32 antibody decreased the viability of normal plasma cells (CD38++ CD19+) more than that of myeloma cells (CD38++ CD19-); CD32-mediated growth suppression was greater in mature MPC-1+ cells than in immature MPC-1- cells.
MPC-1	myeloma	To date, at least 5 subpopulations of plasma cells have been identified in the bone marrow of multiple myeloma (MM) patients with regard to the expression of MPC-1, CD49e (VLA-5), and CD45: MPC-1(-)CD49e(-)CD45(+) proliferative immature cells, MPC-1(-)CD49e(-)CD45(-) immature myeloma cells, MPC-1(+)CD49e(-)CD45(-) and MPC-1(+)CD49e(-)CD45(+) intermediate myeloma cells, and MPC-1(+)CD49e(+)CD45(+) mature myeloma cells.
MPC-1	myeloma	In 31 cases of progressive MM disease, MPC-1(-) immature and MPC-1(-)CD45(+) proliferative immature myeloma cells were significantly increased up to &gt;25% and &gt;10%, respectively, of the plasma cell fractions (CD38(++) cells), whereas there were no increases in MPC-1(-) or MPC-1(-)CD45(+) proliferative immature myeloma cells in 15 cases of stable disease.
MPC-1	MGUS	Interestingly, the proportions of MPC-1(-) and MPC-1(-)CD45(+) immature monoclonal plasma cells also increased in the 7 progressive cases of MGUS.
MPC1	myeloma	Results with flow cytometry using a combination of MPC1, CD49e, and CD45 supported the morphologic findings for the myeloma cells.
SNF1LK	congenital heart defects	Interestingly, the region encompassing the SNF1LK locus has been implicated in congenital heart defects often observed in patients with Down syndrome.
CD14	arthritis	On the other hand, a significant increase was demonstrated in CD14-positive cells at 3 weeks after immunization in only arthritis-developed monkeys regardless of sex.
CD14	rheumatoid arthritis	We previously reported the accumulation of abnormal myeloid cell populations reacting with CD14 (MY4) monoclonal antibody in the iliac and epiphyseal bone marrow of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
CD14	rheumatoid arthritis	Prior to treatment, monocyte-macrophage activation in rheumatoid arthritis was signified by an increased expression of HLA-class II antigens and the CD14 antigen, and by an increased production of neopterin and interleukin-1.
CD14	rheumatoid arthritis	Monocytes, defined by staining with the Mo-2 and Leu-M3 monoclonal antibodies which both detect the CD14 antigen, were studied in peripheral blood of control subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis as well as in rheumatoid synovial fluid of the latter for expression of activation/differentiation markers.
FC receptor-like-3	type 1 diabetes mellitus	We review recent findings implicating variants of FCRL3 (gene for FC receptor-like-3 protein), SCGB3A2 (gene for secretory uteroglobin-related protein 1- UGRP1) as well as other unverified possible candidate genes for GD selected through their documented association with type 1 diabetes mellitus: Tenr-IL2-IL21, CAPSL (encoding calcyphosine-like protein), IFIH1(gene for interferon-induced helicase C domain 1), AFF3, CD226 and PTPN2.
FCRL3	diabetes	Autoantibody-positive diabetic subjects (n = 1,384) and population-based control subjects (n = 2,235) were genotyped at 20 childhood-onset type 1 diabetes loci and FCRL3, GAD2, TCF7L2, and FTO.
FCRL3	diabetes	We analyzed the same four 5' FCRL3 single nucleotide polymorphism markers, together with three additional exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms in the FCRL3 gene, in cohorts of white Caucasians with Graves' disease (n = 625), type 1 diabetes (n = 279), autoimmune Addison's disease (AAD; n = 200), and RA (n = 769).
Galectin-9	encephalomyelitis	In vivo, in a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we show that an agonist of DR3 suppressed disease, correlating with expansion of CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs, and this protective effect was lost in Galectin-9-/- mice.
Galectin-9	RRMS	Galectin-9 concentrations in CSF were higher in SPMS patients than healthy controls and RRMS patients in both cohorts.
CD43	systemic lupus erythematosus	Our objective is to identify phenotypically the position of CD43(+) B cells among peripheral B-lineage cell compartments in healthy donors, with reference to B-cell subsets from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
CD43	systemic lupus erythematosus	Previous studies indicate that CD43 plays a role in regulating the adhesion of lymphocytes, cell mutation and activation, however, little is known about its effect on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Ficolin-3	membranous nephropathy	Two new cases of primary Ficolin-3 deficiency are reported here: a 50-year old male, suffering from membranous nephropathy and an 11-month old male infant who was operated on to repair congenital heart disease.
Mim	sinusitis	In order to investigate its potential pathogenicity for turkeys a UK isolate of Mim from a partridge with sinusitis was first passaged through turkey poults and then assessed for pathogenicity in turkey embryo tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) and in one-day-old turkey poults with or without turkey rhinotracheitis virus (TRTV).
AMPs	sinusitis	Both up- and down-regulation of the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) of the sinonasal mucosa have already been associated with the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis with (CRSwNP) or without (CRSsNP) nasal polyps.
endopeptidase 24.15	Wilson disease	It is suggested that elevated plasma nociceptin level found in Wilson disease patients is due to inhibition of nociceptin-inactivating Zn-metallopeptidases (aminopeptidase N (APN) and endopeptidase 24.15) by the toxic copper deposits in liver and/or brain.
transferrin	acute myocardial infarction	It is evident from the study that body iron (serum iron, TIBC &amp; transferrin saturation) level significantly increases among acute myocardial infarction patients in Bangladesh.
transferrin	acute myocardial infarction	We investigated the relation of NTBI, serum iron, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin with risk of CHD and acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
CYP2E	hepatoma	In this study, the effects of chiral pesticide metalaxyl on CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B1, CYP2B2, CYP2E1 and CYP3A were investigated in human hepatoma HepG2, rat hepatic H4IIE, chicken hepatic LMH and grass carp hepatic L8824 cells.
CYP2E	cancer	ER+ cancers exhibited lower ADORA1, ADORA2B, and RYR1 and elevated PDE4A, CYP2A6, and CYP2E expressions.
cytochrome P4502E1	B-cell lymphoma	The mechanisms were investigated by detecting levels of NADPH Oxidase 4 (NOX4),p22phox, cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1),Bax,B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2),cleaved-caspase 3 and 9 and phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinases(ERK),phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting.
CYP2E	cancer	Twenty-two variants from 21 genes (APEX1 rs1130409 and rs1760944, ATM rs664677, AXIN2 rs2240308, CHRNA3 rs6495309, CHRNA5 rs16969968, CLPTM1L rs402710, CXCR2 rs1126579, CYP1A1 rs4646903, CYP2E1 rs6413432, ERCC1 rs11615, ERCC2 rs13181, FGFR4 rs351855, HYKK rs931794, MIR146A rs2910164, MIR196A2 rs11614913, OGG1 rs1052133, PON1 rs662, REV3L rs462779, SOD2 rs4880, TERT rs2736098, and TP53 rs1042522) showed significant associations with lung cancer susceptibility with strong cumulative epidemiological evidence.
ANGPTL4	renal cell carcinoma	This study aimed to determine the serum levels of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and explore its potential as a biomarker.
angiopoietin-like 4	renal-cell carcinoma	We have previously shown that angiopoietin-like 4 (angptl4) mRNA, a hypoxia-inducible gene, is highly expressed in clear cell renal-cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common subtype of RCC for which no specific marker is available.
ANGPTL4	conventional renal cell carcinoma	We observed particularly high levels of ANGPTL4 mRNA in tumor cells of conventional renal cell carcinoma.
SP-D	NSIP	Results The smoking subgroup (n=15) of NSIP patients had a significantly lower % diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide/ alveolar ventilation (DLCO/VA) and tended to have higher SP-D values than the nonsmoking subgroup (n=16).
SP-D	nonspecific interstitial pneumonia	As compared with major IIPs such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and fibrotic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, IPPFE significantly showed higher frequency of cases with a unique pattern of serum biomarkers, which is characterized by an elevated level of SP-D with a normal range of KL-6.
SP-D	NSIP	However, associations of serum KL-6 and SP-D with radiologic findings in nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) remain unclear.
SP-D	NSIP	To determine whether serum levels of KL-6 and SP-D reflect fibrotic and/or inflammatory processes in NSIP, we investigated the correlation between high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings and serum KL-6 and SP-D levels.
SP-D	NSIP	Serum levels of KL-6 and SP-D were measured in 21 patients with biopsy-confirmed NSIP.
SP-D	NSIP	Serum levels of SP-D in NSIP showed a positive correlation with the area of ground-glass attenuation without traction bronchiectasis and the inflammatory CT pattern, but the levels were inversely correlated with the area of ground-glass attenuation with traction bronchiectasis and the fibrotic CT pattern.
SP-D	NSIP	The results indicate that serum levels of KL-6 in NSIP reflect the overall extent of interstitial lesions, which include both inflammatory and fibrotic lesions, while the levels of SP-D mainly reflect the extent of inflammatory lesions.
ARHGAP11A	cancer	Recently, we identified high expression of 2 RHOGAPs, ARHGAP11A and RACGAP1, in the basal-like breast cancer subtype.
ArhGAP11A	cancer	We have established that, via the suppression of RhoA, ArhGAP11A and RacGAP1 are both critical drivers of BLBC growth, and propose that RhoGAPs can act as oncogenes in cancer.
ARHGAP11A	cancer	We found significant methylation differences at a number of experimentally implicated breast cancer-related genes, including attenuated 5' untranslated region (UTR)/first exon methylation at the proinvasive ARHGAP11A gene in variant mimic-transfected cells.
ARHGAP11A	cancer	Follow-up functional analyses revealed both concurrent increased ARHGAP11A mRNA expression and enhanced invasiveness in variant versus WT piR-021285 mimic-transfected breast cancer cell lines.
ARHGAP11A	cancer	Expression of ARHGAP11A in cancer cells suppressed RhoA-dependent mechanisms, such as stress fiber formation and focal adhesion, which made the cells more prone to migrate.
Arhgap11a	cancer	RNAi-based inhibition of Arhgap11a reduced the invasion and in vivo expansion of cancers.
Arhgap11a	cancer	Additionally, analysis of human specimens showed the significant up-regulation of Arhgap11a in colon cancers, which was correlated with clinical invasion status.
ARHGAP11A	cancer	The present study suggests that ARHGAP11A, a cell cycle-dependent RhoGAP, is a critical regulator of cancer cell mobility and is thus a promising therapeutic target in invasive cancers.
ARHGAP11A	obesity	Identified genome-wide significant loci: 1) corroborated genes implicated in other studies (MTNR1B, ZNF259/APOA5, XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2), DARC, CCR3, ABO); 2) localized novel genes in plausible biological pathways (PCSK2, ARHGAP11A, CHRNA3); and 3) revealed novel genes with unknown function in obesity pathogenesis (MATK, COL4A1).
ARHGAP11A	congenital heart defect	In contrast to GTG banding, array CGH determined the exact number of deleted genes and thus allowed the identification of candidate genes for cleft palate (GREM1, CX36, MEIS2), congenital heart defect (ACTC, GREM1, CX36, MEIS2), and mental retardation (ARHGAP11A, CHRNA7, CHRM5).
NME6	Crohn's disease	The expression levels of four genes identified by microarray screening (PLCB2, HVCN1, CTSS, and DEF8) and one purine/thiopurine related gene (NME6) correlated significantly with the clinical activity of Crohn's disease.
ZNF366	breast cancer	ZNF366, involved in estrogen metabolism and progression of breast cancer, is a new biologically plausible candidate for endometriosis.
DC-SCRIPT	breast cancer	Recently, we have identified DC-SCRIPT (ZNF366) as a co-suppressor of ERAlfa and as a strong and independent prognostic marker in ESR1 (ERAlfa gene)-positive breast cancer patients.
DC-SCRIPT	breast cancer	In this study, we further investigated the molecular mechanism on how DC-SCRIPT inhibits breast cancer cell growth.
DC-SCRIPT	breast tumor	DC-SCRIPT mRNA levels from 190 primary ESR1-positive breast tumors were related to global gene expression, followed by gene ontology and pathway analysis.
DC-SCRIPT	breast cancer	The effect of DC-SCRIPT on breast cancer cell growth and cell cycle arrest was investigated using novel DC-SCRIPT-inducible MCF7 breast cancer cell lines.
DC-SCRIPT	breast tumor	In the primary ESR1-positive breast tumors, DC-SCRIPT expression negatively correlated with several cell cycle gene ontologies and pathways.
DC-SCRIPT	breast cancer	DC-SCRIPT expression strongly reduced breast cancer cell growth in vitro, breast tumor growth in vivo, and induced cell cycle arrest.
DC-SCRIPT	breast tumor	Moreover, in 1,132 primary ESR1-positive breast tumors, DC-SCRIPT expression also correlated with CDKN2B expression.
DC-SCRIPT	breast cancer	Collectively, these data show that DC-SCRIPT acts as a novel regulator of CDKN2B and induces cell cycle arrest in ESR1-positive breast cancer cells.
DC-SCRIPT	breast cancer	We recently found that DC-SCRIPT is a prognostic marker in breast cancer and a unique NR coregulator differentially regulating different classes of NRs.
DC-SCRIPT	breast cancer	In this study we aimed to validate the prognostic value of DC-SCRIPT mRNA expression in a large independent breast cancer cohort.
DC-SCRIPT	breast cancer	DC-SCRIPT mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR in 1,505 primary invasive breast cancers and associated with outcome (disease-free survival (DFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS)) using univariate and multivariable Cox regression analysis.
DC-SCRIPT	primary breast cancer	This study provides a higher level of evidence that DC-SCRIPT is indeed an independent, pure prognostic, factor for primary breast cancer and shows that DC-SCRIPT mRNA expression is most informative for either ESR1-positive and/or ESR2-low pT1 tumors.
DC-SCRIPT	breast cancer	We investigated the role of dendritic cell-specific transcript (DC-SCRIPT) as coregulator of these nuclear receptors and as a prognostic factor in breast cancer.
DC-SCRIPT	breast cancer	DC-SCRIPT expression in normal and tumor tissue from breast cancer patients was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.
DC-SCRIPT	breast cancer	The prognostic value of tumor DC-SCRIPT mRNA expression was assessed in three independent cohorts of breast cancer patients: a discovery group (n = 47) and a validation group (n = 97) (neither of which had received systemic adjuvant therapy) and in a tamoxifen-treated validation group (n = 68) by using a DC-SCRIPT to porphobilinogen deaminase transcript ratio cutoff of 0.15 determined in the discovery group.
DC-SCRIPT	breast cancer	DC-SCRIPT is a key regulator of nuclear receptor activity that has prognostic value in breast cancer.
KLK2	breast cancer	Both SNP and gene-based analyses showed promising associations with breast cancer risk for 17 genes: OR10J3, FCER1A, NCF4, CNTNAP1, CTNNB1, KLKB1, ITGB2, ALOX12B, KLK2, IRAK3, KLK4, STAT6, NCF2, CCL1, C1QR1, MBP and NOS1.
hK2	breast cancer	When the data were divided by menopausal status, the optimal models to predict breast cancer, which included NAF hK2 or PSA and age, were 100% sensitive and 41% specific in pre- vs. 93% sensitive and 12% specific in postmenopausal women.
KLK2	breast cancer	Several lines of evidence suggest that members of the kallikrein family are involved in various malignancies such as prostate (PSA, KLK2, KLK15), ovarian (KLK4, KLK5, KLK6, KLK8, KLK10), and breast cancer (KLK10, KLK13, KLK14).
hK2	breast cancer	We examined previously the steroid hormone regulation of 2 known androgen-regulated kallikreins, KLK3 (encoding PSA) and KLK2 (encoding human kallikrein 2 or hK2) in BT-474, T-47D, ZR75-1, MCF-7, MFM-223 and BT-20 human breast cancer cells and found that they were differentially regulated, with the cells showing variable responses to androgen.
KLK2	breast cancer	Every breast cancer cell line exhibited a distinct expression pattern of the nuclear receptor co-regulators examined raising the possibility that the relative levels of these co-activators/-repressors might differentially modulate androgen receptor transcriptional activity within the promoter/enhancer region of KLK2 and KLK3 of these cells.
KLK2	breast cancer	Like KLK2 and KLK3, the KLK5 gene is regulated by steroid hormones in the BT-474 breast cancer cell line.

BLs	Burkitt lymphoma	For the first time, we report different genetic anomalies between adult and paediatric BLs, suggesting age-related heterogeneity in Burkitt lymphomagenesis.
BLs	B-cell lymphoma	Although there are conflicting data regarding prognostic implications of isolated MYC aberrancy in these non-BLs, the co-occurrence of MYC rearrangements and either the antiapoptotic gene B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) or the transcriptional repressor BCL6 leads to an entity termed double-hit B-cell lymphoma (DHL) (or triple-hit if all 3 abnormalities are observed) with a particularly poor prognosis and no established treatment paradigms.
BLs	diffuse large B-cell lymphoma	The clinicopathologic findings in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) may show significant overlap, and MYC abnormalities, found in all BLs, also occur in a subset of DLBCL.

SOXN	neuroblastoma	These results identify SOXN as a major player in regulating the sensitization of neuroblastoma cells for IFN-gamma-induced apoptosis.
melanoma inhibitory activity	rheumatoid arthritis	The cartilage proteins melanoma inhibitory activity (MIA) and human cartilage gp-39 (HC gp-39) are candidate autoantigens in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
CDRAP	osteoarthritis	The presented results confirm expression of CDRAP by normal and osteoarthritic articular chondrocytes, but indicate that increased expression levels by chondrocytes are not the cause of the increased levels of CDRAP in the synovial fluid of patients with osteoarthritis.
CD-RAP	rheumatoid arthritis	We have measured the concentration of cartilage-derived retinoic-acid-sensitive protein (CD-RAP) in synovial fluid (SF) from the knees of 49 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and 79 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in order to investigate the correlation between the type of joint disease and level of CD-RAP.
TSC2	uterine leiomyoma	In this study, we demonstrated that osteopontin (OPN) was dramatically reduced by loss of TSC1/TSC2 complex in Tsc2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), rat uterine leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-deficient cells, genetically modified mouse TSC models, and clinical samples.
TSC2	uterine leiomyoma	TSC2-deficient Eker rat uterine leiomyoma ELT3 cells were stably transfected with empty vector or plasmid for the expression of TSC2.
Tsc2	uterine leiomyoma	By analyzing Tsc2-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and rat uterine leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-null ELT3 cells, we detected evidence for the involvement of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) as a downstream target of mTORC1 in the development of TSC tumors.
TSC2	uterine leiomyoma	TSC2-positive and TSC2-negative mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), 323-TSC2-positive and 323-TSC2-null MEF and Eker rat uterine leiomyoma (ELT3) cells were treated with doxycycline or rapamycin alone, or in combination.
TSC2	uterine leiomyoma	Importantly, rapamycin treatment did not affect the expression of AdPLA2 and the production of PGE2 by TSC2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast (Tsc2-/-MEFs), rat uterine leiomyoma-derived ELT3 cells, and LAM patient-associated renal angiomyolipoma-derived "mesenchymal" cells.
Tuberous Sclerosis 2	uterine leiomyoma	Loss of the Tuberous Sclerosis 2 (TSC2) tumor suppressor has been proposed as a mechanism important for the etiology of uterine leiomyomata based on the Eker rat model.
TSC2	uterine leiomyoma	However, conflicting evidence showing increased TSC2 expression has been reported in human uterine leiomyomata, suggesting that TSC2 might not be involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder.
TSC2	uterine leiomyoma	In cell culture models of TSC2-deficient LAM patient-derived and rat uterine leiomyoma-derived cells, we found that progesterone treatment or progesterone plus estradiol resulted in increased phosphorylation of Protein Kinase B (Akt) and Extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2 (ERK1/2), induced the proliferation, and enhanced the migration and invasiveness.
Tsc2	uterine leiomyoma	We report here that expression of AlfaB-crystallin was upregulated in Tsc1-/- or Tsc2-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Eker rat uterine leiomyoma-derived Tsc2-deficient ELT3 cells, mutant Tsc2-associated mouse kidney tumors, and human lung lymphangioleiomyomatosis nodules.
Tsc2	uterine leiomyoma	Female Eker rats harboring an insertional deletion in one copy of the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) gene develop uterine leiomyoma, but the underlying mechanism of human uterine leiomyoma is not completely understood.
TSC2	uterine leiomyoma	To examine whether down-regulation of tuberin, a TSC2 gene product, is present in human uterine leiomyoma, we analyzed leiomyoma and matched myometrium tissues from 22 Chinese patients with Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses, and found that the expression of tuberin was significantly increased in leiomyoma tissues compared with matched myometrium tissues with inhibition of both the mammalian target of rapacmycin pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways.
Tsc2	uterine leiomyoma	Cells derived from an Eker rat uterine leiomyoma (ELT3 cells) are Tsc2-null and these have been used in a rodent cell models for LAM.

furin	rheumatoid arthritis	Inhibition of furin enhances invasive phenotype of synoviocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, implying a protective role of furin.
furin	rheumatoid arthritis	Agents targeting upregulation of furin may have therapeutic potential for rheumatoid arthritis.
furin	arthritis	The effect of furin and its inhibitor Alfa1-PDX was tested in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA).
furin	arthritis	Systemic administration of furin prevented increases in the arthritis score, joint destruction, and bone loss, in contrast to systemic administration of the furin inhibitor Alfa1-PDX, which enhanced these parameters.
furin	arthritis	They also suggest that Adamts5 induction in joint components other than cartilage, and its post-translational activation by PACE4 and/or furin may be important in the pathophysiology of arthritis.

NRG1	lung cancer	In patient 1 an SDC4-NRG1 gene fusion was detected, similar gene fusions having been described in lung cancers previously.
NRG1	lung cancer	Unexpected molecular lesions of the NRG1 gene followed by an aberrant ErbB signaling were recently described as a new molecular features of non-small cell lung cancer, but it has been also sporadically reported in other tumors.
NRG1	lung cancer	We highlight the current knowledge about the ErbB network and NRG1 deregulation in lung cancer and their merger into the ErbB/PI3K-AKT axis modulation and current therapeutic strategies.
NRG1	lung cancer	More advances in knowledge of crosstalk between NRG1, ErbB3 and PI3K-AKT pathways may increase and strongly support the therapeutic choice for lung cancer patients.

TAB2	congenital heart defects	Haploinsufficiency of TAB2 was recently implicated as a cause for a variety of congenital heart defects.
TAB2	congenital heart defects	This is the smallest reported deletion involving TAB2 that segregates with congenital heart defects.
TAB2	congenital heart defects	Findings from this family support a key role of TAB2 haploinsufficiency in congenital heart defects and expand the phenotypic spectrum of TAB2-microdeletion syndrome.
TAB2	congenital heart defect	In addition, the present deletion is the smallest so far recorded in the 6q25 region encompassing eight known genes [vs. 41 of Bisgaard et al., and 23 of Caselli et al.,], including the TAB2 (likely responsible for the girl's congenital heart defect), LATS1 gene, and the UST gene (a regulator of the homeostasis of proteoglycans, which could have played a role in the abnormal dermal and cartilage elasticity).
hPAD2	multiple sclerosis	The isozymes hPAD2 and hPAD4 have been implicated in the development and progression of several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.

PADI2	multiple sclerosis	Recent studies have revealed that abnormal activation of PADI2, the gene for which is expressed throughout the nervous system, is likely to be related to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases with neurodegenerative processes, such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.
RANKL	OSCC	VEGF-Flt-1 signaling induces osteoclastogenesis in OSCC through two possible ways: 1) VEGF produced from OSCC cells can directly stimulate the Flt-1 pathway in preosteoclasts to induce migration to future bone resorbing area and differentiation into osteoclasts, and 2) VEGF-Flt-1 signaling upregulates RANKL expression in OSCC cells, which indirectly leads to osteoclast differentiation.
RANKL	cancer	Thus, the transcriptional targets normally activated by RANKL that promote a proliferative response in luminal progenitors can contribute to the susceptibility of mammary epithelial cells to BRCA1-mutated breast cancers as a consequence of DDR-induced NF-kappaB.
RANKL	cancer	Our finding provides mechanistic support for a breast cancer chemoprevention trial with a RANKL inhibitor among high-risk premenopausal women with dense breasts.

RANKL	NSCLC	We measured the concentration of OPG and sRANKL in BALF of 44 NSCLC patients and 15 healthy volunteers taken as control subjects.
RANKL	NSCLC	There were no significant differences in sRANKL content between the NSCLC and control groups [1.22 (0.74-23.00) vs. 1.12 (0.79-4.39) pmol/l; p = 0.67].
RANKL	NSCLC	However, we found that the greater the level of sRANKL in NSCLC patients, the shorter the overall survival.
RANKL	NSCLC	We found a correlation between the content of sRANKL and the percentage of lymphocytes in BALF of NSCLC patients (r = 0.52; p = 0.041).
RANKL	NSCLC	A high level of sRANKL in BALF of NSCLC patients may predict worse survival.

RIPK1	hepatocellular carcinoma	Here, we discuss our recent data on RIPK1 in liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma development and put these into relation to previous experimental findings to underpin that it exerts opposing kinase-dependent and kinase independent functions in liver cells.
Ripk1	hepatocellular carcinoma	Moreover, loss of both Ripk1 and Traf2 in LPC not only resulted in caspase-8 hyperactivation but also impaired NF-KB activation, promoting the spontaneous development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
APOBEC3H	cancer	The single-stranded DNA cytidine deaminases APOBEC3B, APOBEC3H haplotype I, and APOBEC3A can contribute to cancer through deamination of cytosine to form promutagenic uracil in genomic DNA.
APOBEC3H	cancer	To study this, we developed a method to purify full length APOBEC3B and characterized it in comparison to APOBEC3A and APOBEC3H on substrates relevant to cancer mutagenesis.
A3H	carcinoma	A3H-I also associates with clonal TCA/T-biased mutations in lung adenocarcinoma suggesting this enzyme makes broader contributions to cancer mutagenesis.
A3H	cancer	These studies combine to suggest that A3B and A3H-I, together, explain the bulk of 'APOBEC signature' mutations in cancer.
APOBEC3H	cancer	TCGA data analyses revealed that expression of APOBEC3D and APOBEC3H also correlates with CD3D across multiple cancer types.

USP22	retinoblastoma	USP22 is one of the important targets for inhibiting tumor growth, but clear illustration regarding its effects of telomerase, tumor cell immortality and retinoblastoma cell aging or apoptosis via suppressing TERT/P53 signal pathway remains to be elusive.
USP22	retinoblastoma	USP22 played an important role in retinoblastoma cell proliferation/aging and apoptosis.
USP22	retinoblastoma	The reduction of USP22 expression facilitated human retinoblastoma cell aging or apoptosis via suppressing TERT/P53 signal pathway.
USP22	retinoblastoma	USP22, thus, may work as a target for treating retinoblastoma.

CRX	retinal disease	We found that retinal disease-related genes were efficiently detected in CRX-transduced cells, most of which are crucial to photoreceptor functions.
CRX	retinal disease	Moreover, by modification of the culture conditions including additional transduction of RAX1 and NEUROD1, we found a greater variety of retinal disease-related genes than that observed in CRX-transduced PBMCs.
CRX	retinal degeneration	These data suggest that CRX acts as a master control gene for reprogramming PBMCs into photoreceptor-like cells and that our induced photoreceptor-like cells might contribute to individualized drug screening and disease modeling of inherited retinal degeneration.

PGBD3	Cockayne syndrome	In primates, a PGBD3 element inserted into the Cockayne syndrome group B (CSB) gene over 43 Mya serves as an alternative 3' terminal exon, enabling the CSB gene to generate both full length CSB and a conserved CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein that joins an N-terminal CSB domain to the C-terminal transposase domain.
PGBD3	Cockayne syndrome	The CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein arose more than 43 million years ago when a 2.5-kb piggyBac 3 (PGBD3) transposon inserted into intron 5 of the Cockayne syndrome Group B (CSB) gene in the common ancestor of all higher primates.
PGBD3	Cockayne syndrome	Our data suggest that the CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein is important in both health and disease, and could play a role in Cockayne syndrome.
MBs	CADASIL	In this study, we searched for cerebral MBs in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), a unique type of small-vessel disease caused by mutations in the Notch3 gene.

MBs	CADASIL	The average number of MBs was 5.9+/-7.3 (range, 0 to 22) in individual CADASIL patients.
MBs	CADASIL	This study shows a high frequency and multiplicity of MBs in individuals with CADASIL.
ATPase is	gastritis	At stimulation, the tubulovesicles fuse with the apical canaliculi and the HK-ATPase is incorporated into the apical membrane where it actively pumps H ions in exchange for K. Acute infection with Helicobacter pylori results in hypochlorhydria, whereas chronic infection can cause either hypo- or hyperchlorhydria, depending on the distribution of the infection and the degree of corpus gastritis.
ATPase is	gastritis	The results directly confirm that the gastric H+/K(+)-ATPase is the causative autoantigen in the genesis of autoimmune gastritis.
ATPase is	gastritis	We conclude that the beta subunit of the gastric H/K ATPase is a major T cell target in autoimmune gastritis and that thymic expression of a single autoantigen can abrogate an autoimmune response to multiple autoantigens.

CDKN3	cancer	CDKN3 is often overexpressed in human cancer, and this overexpression correlates with reduced survival in several types of cancer.
CDKN3	cancer	The mechanism of CDKN3 overexpression and the role of CDKN3 transcript variants in human cancer are not entirely clear.
CDKN3	cancer	Besides the full-length CDKN3 encoding transcript and a major transcript that skips exon 2 express in normal and cancer cells, minor aberrant transcript variants have been reported.
CDKN3	cancer	Aberrant CDKN3 transcripts were postulated to encode dominant-negative inhibitors of CDKN3 as an explanation for overexpression of the perceived tumor suppressor gene in human cancer.
CDKN3	cancer	However, while CDKN3 is often overexpressed in human cancer, aberrant CDKN3 transcripts occur infrequently and at lower levels.
CDKN3	cancer	CDKN3 mutations and copy number alternation are rare in human cancer, implying that neither loss of CDKN3 activity nor constitutive gain of CDKN3 expression offer an advantage to tumorigenesis.
CDKN3	cancer	Given that rapidly growing tumors have more mitotic cells, the high level of mitotic CDKN3 expression is the most plausible mechanism of frequent CDKN3 overexpression in human cancer.
CDKN3	cancer	This finding clarifies the mechanism of CDKN3 overexpression in human cancer and questions the view of CDKN3 as a tumor suppressor.
CDKN3	cancer	Abnormal expression of CDKN3 has been found in numerous types of cancer.
CDKN3	cancer	Since it is unclear whether CDKN3 participates in the development of human gastric cancer, this study assessed the association between CDKN3 expression and cell biological function and demonstrated the clinical significance and prognosis of CDKN3 in human gastric cancer.
CDKN3	cancer	In this study, we found that CDKN3 showed a high expression in 35 paired human gastric cancer tissues and was correlated with poor patient survival, AJCC clinical staging, and recurrence.
CDKN3	cancer	Silencing of CDKN3 in human gastric cancer cells can significantly reduce proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion abilities.
CDKN3	cancer	Also, silencing of CDKN3 in human gastric cancer cells can induce G0-G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
CDKN3	cancer	Detection of cell cycle marker expression showed that CDKN3 knockdown promotes cell cycle arrest by decreasing the expression of CDK2, CDC25A, CCNB1, and CCNB2 in human gastric cancer cells.
CDKN3	cancer	The results of this study will help elucidate the oncogene function of CDKN3 in human gastric cancer.
CDKN3	cancer	However, whether CDKN3 is a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer remains to be elucidated.
CDKN3	cancer	The present in vitro study aimed to investigate the potential roles of CDKN3 in breast cancer.
CDKN3	cancer	Breast cancer cell lines were used to detect CDKN3 expression, and CDKN3 expression was silenced to investigate its role in cell apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and migration.
CDKN3	cancer	These results suggest that CDKN3 acts as an oncogene during breast cancer progression.
CDKN3	cancer	CDKN3 may therefore be considered a potential target for the treatment of breast cancer.
CDKN3	cancer	Paradoxically, CDKN3 is often overexpressed in human cancer.
CDKN3	lung adenocarcinoma	We analysed CDKN3 expression and its association with patient survival in three cohorts of lung adenocarcinoma.
CDKN3	Cancer	We also examined CDKN3 mutations in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Moffitt Cancer Center's Total Cancer Care (TCC) projects.
CDKN3	lung adenocarcinoma	CDKN3 transcripts were further analysed in a panel of cell lines and lung adenocarcinoma tissues.
CDKN3	cancer	CDKN3 is overexpressed in non small cell lung cancer.
CDKN3	lung adenocarcinoma	High CDKN3 expression is associated with poor overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma.
CDKN3	lung adenocarcinoma	CDKN3 overexpression is prognostic of poor overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma.
CDKN3	lung adenocarcinoma	CDKN3 overexpression in lung adenocarcinoma is not attributed to alternative splicing or mutation but is likely due to increased mitotic activity, arguing against CDKN3 as a tumour suppressor.
CDKN3	cancer	The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 3 (CDKN3) gene, involved in mitosis, is upregulated in cervical cancer (CC).
CDKN3	cancer	The aim of this study is to investigate the possible mechanisms of silence of CDKN3 exerting the suppressive role on epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).
CDKN3	cancer	Functional studies showed that silence of CDKN3 inhibited cancer cell proliferation by promoting cell cycle progression in G1 phase, decreased cell invasion and promoted EOC cells apoptosis.
CDKN3	cancer	These findings indicated that CDKN3 might serve as a useful potential target for treatment of ovarian cancer.
CDKN3	colorectal cancer	We first discovered the pro-tumor effect of a controversial cell cycle regulator, cylin-dependent kinase inhibitor 3 (CDKN3), which is highly expressed in colorectal cancer, and the possible related signaling pathways, by bioinformatics tools.

CDKN3	colorectal cancer	Our study, for the first time, provided consistent evidence showing overexpression of cell cycle regulator CDKN3, in colorectal cancer.
CDKN3	colorectal cancer	The in vitro studies in SW480 cells revealed a unique role of CDKN3 in regulating cellular behavior of colorectal cancer cells, and implied the possibility of targeting CDKN3 as a novel treatment for colorectal cancer.
CDKN3	chronic myelogenous leukemia	However, the role of CDKN3 in Bcr-Abl-mediated chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) remains unknown.
CDKN3	leukemia	In contrast, depletion of CDKN3 expression conferred resistance to imatinib-induced apoptosis in the leukemic cells and accelerated the growth of xenograph leukemia in mice.
CDKN3	leukemia	Our results highlight the importance of CDKN3 in Bcr-Abl-mediated leukemogenesis, and provide new insights into diagnostics and therapeutics of the leukemia.

circadian locomoter output cycles protein kaput	colorectal cancer	The present study demonstrated that the protein expression levels of human circadian locomoter output cycles protein kaput (hCLOCK) is significantly increased, while miR-124 is attenuated in high-grade human CRC tissues and in the more invasive colorectal cancer cell lines SW620 and LOVO.
CLOCK	cancer	The CLOCK gene may be designated as a novel candidate for targeted gene therapy in drug-resistant ovarian cancer.
CLOCK	prostate cancer	Study distribution by tumor was as follows: breast cancer (n=15), prostate cancer (n=3), pancreatic cancer (n=2), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n=2), glioma (n=1), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=1), colorectal cancer (n=1), non-small cell lung cancer (n=1) and ovarian cancer (n=1).We identified 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with cancer risk: NPAS2 rs10165970 (mixed and breast cancer shiftworkers), rs895520 (mixed), rs17024869 (breast) and rs7581886 (breast); CLOCK rs3749474 (breast) and rs11943456 (breast); RORA rs7164773 (breast and breast cancer postmenopausal), rs10519097 (breast); RORB rs7867494 (breast cancer postmenopausal), PER3 rs1012477 (breast cancer subgroups) and assessed the level of quality evidence to be intermediate.

IDE	hyperinsulinemia	These results indicate that treatment with TUDCA may be helpful to counteract obesity-induced hyperinsulinemia through increasing insulin clearance, likely through enhanced liver IDE expression in a mechanism dependent on S1PR2-Insulin pathway activation.
Insulin-degrading enzyme	diabetes	Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a ubiquitous zinc peptidase of the inverzincin family, which has been initially discovered as the enzyme responsible for insulin catabolism; therefore, its involvement in the onset of diabetes has been largely investigated.
IDE	type 2 diabetes mellitus	Impairment of the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
IDE	diabetes	Several mechanisms have been reported underlying the association of the two disorders, diabetes and dementia, one among which is the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) which is known to degrade insulin as well beta-amyloid peptides.
IDE	hyperinsulinemia	We concluded that vitamin D3 ameliorated insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in diabetic rat model received HFW through reduction of IDE and activation of insulin receptor phosphorylation.

Cpn	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	The objective of the study was to investigate the possible association of Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn) in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
Cpn	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	Reading this article will familiarize the reader with (1) the unique chlamydial intracellular life cycle and the propensity for human chlamydial infections to become persistent and to result in immunopathologic (inflammatory) damage in target organs and (2) current evidence linking Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn) infection to obstructive lung diseases (asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD).
Cpn	obstructive lung disease	Although the full clinical significance of these Cpn-obstructive lung disease associations remains to be established, reports of asthma improvement after treatment of Cpn infection deserve further investigation.
Bnip3	NSCLC	Taken together, we conclude that EGFR TKIs enhance the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to vATPase inhibitors by decreasing Hif-1Alfa/Bnip3 expression.
BNIP3	lung cancer	We found a significant upregulation of BNIP3 in human lung cancer datasets, and we identified a direct association between BNIP3 expression and survival rate of lung cancer patients.
BNIP3	NSCLC	In this study we used 115 NSCLC tissues to examine the immunohistochemical expression of four distinct molecules - the major regulator of autophagy Beclin 1, the anti-apoptotic and anti-autophagic protein Bcl-2, the pro-apoptotic and pro-autophagic protein BNIP3, and a marker of hypoxia and glucolysis, the glucose transporter Glut 1.
BNIP3	NSCLC	In conclusion, the accelerated autophagic status in NSCLC is unrelated to Beclin 1 and BNIP3 expression, but does show significant association with Bcl-2 reactivity.

CARD11	MALT lymphoma	We showed that: (1) there was a significant association between the biased usage of IGHV4-34 (binds to the carbohydrate I/i antigens) and inactivating mutation of TNFAIP3 [encoding a global negative regulator of the canonical nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) pathway] in ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma; (2) IGHV1-69 was significantly overrepresented (54%) in MALT lymphoma of the salivary gland, but was not associated with mutation in any of the 17 genes investigated; and (3) MALT lymphoma lacked mutations that are frequently seen in other B-cell lymphomas characterized by constitutive NF-KB activities, including mutations in CD79B, CARD11, MYD88, TNFRSF11A, and TRAF3.
endothelin-1	arthritis	Therefore, we aim to assess the correlation of endothelin-1 concentrations with the development and severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA).
ET-1	arthritis	Together, the results here demonstrate that the febrile response in zymosan-induced arthritis in rats depends on the centrally acting pyrogenic cytokines TNF-Alfa, IL-1Beta, and IL-6, but does not depend on either CRF or ET-1.
AQP1	neuromyelitis optica	Antibodies to AQP4 and AQP1 are detected in neuromyelitis optica and are believed to play a pathogenic role.
AQP1	neuromyelitis optica	Among thirteen different mammalian AQPs, AQP1 and AQP4 have been mainly studied in the CNS and evidence has been presented that they play important roles in the pathogenesis of CNS injury, edema and multiple diseases such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, glioblastoma multiforme, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

gp70	lymphoma	Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) p27 or gp70 antigen was detected in 21 lymphomas (54%).
gp70	lymphoma	Vaccines to large B cell lymphoma were made by the covalent attachment of an epitope from the gp70 glycoprotein (SSWDFITV) to the N-termini of the conformationally biased, response-selective C5a agonists EP54 (YSFKPMPLaR) and EP67 (YSFKDMP(MeL)aR).
gp70	lymphoma	Syngeneic Balb/c mice were immunized with these EP54/EP67-containing vaccines and challenged with a lethal dose of the highly liver metastatic and gp70-expressing lymphoma cell line RAW117-H10 to evaluate the ability of these vaccines to induce protective immune outcomes.
gp70	lymphoma	CD8(+) T lymphocytes activated in response to Vaccines 2 and 3 express cytotoxic specificity for gp70-expressing RAW117-H10 lymphoma cells, but not antigen-irrelevant MDA-MB231A human breast cancer cells.
gp70	leukemia	Our strategy relies on the fact that feline leukemia virus subgroup B (FeLV-B) and amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV) have closely related gp70 surface envelope glycoproteins and use related Na(+)-dependent phosphate symporters, Pit1 and Pit2, respectively, as their receptors.

SDHD	extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma	Authors present the history of a patient with extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma who represents in Hungary the first genetically confirmed case of hereditary paraganglioma/pheochromocytoma syndrome due to disease-causing mutation of the SDHD gene.
SDHD	extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma	While SDHD has been more frequently associated with the pathogenesis of head and neck paragangliomas, SDHB mutations were mainly associated with malignant and/or extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma.
SDHD	extraadrenal pheochromocytoma	SDHB mutation carriers were more likely than SDHD mutation carriers to develop extraadrenal pheochromocytomas and malignant disease, whereas SDHD mutation carriers had a greater propensity to develop head and neck paragangliomas and multiple tumors.
SDHD	extraadrenal pheochromocytoma	In contrast, SDHD mutation carriers, in addition to head and neck paragangliomas, should be observed for multifocal tumors, infrequent malignancy, and the possibility of extraadrenal pheochromocytoma.
SDHD	extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma	However, in the presence of extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma, it may be more useful to screen for VHL, SDHD and SDHB mutations.
POLL	SHFM3	Here we show, using two different techniques, FISH and quantitative PCR that SHFM3 is caused by a minimal 325 kb duplication containing only two genes (BTRC and POLL).
POLL	SHFM3	The smaller duplication in the second patient contained the LBX1, BTRC, POLL, and DPCD genes and a disrupted extra copy of the dactylin gene, and was nearly identical to the smallest known duplicated region of SHFM3.
transferrin	cardiomyopathy	In the diagnostic work-up of alcoholic cardiomyopathy, the confirmation of alcohol abuse by carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) and increased liver enzymes, and the involvement of the heart by markers of heart failure (e.g., NT-proBNP) and of necrosis (e.g., troponins or CKMb) is mandatory.
lag 2	pneumonia	Each 10 myg/m(3) increment in daily mean concentration at lag 2 day was associated with a 0.61% (95% CI: 0.19%, 1.03%) increase in overall respiratory mortality and a 0.67% (95% CI: 0.14%, 1.21%) increase in pneumonia mortality.
lag 2	pneumonia	The values of the relative risks for hospitalization for pneumonia and asthma were significant for lag 0 (RR=1.051, 95%CI; 1.016 to 1.088); lag 2 (RR=1.066, 95%CI: 1.023 to 1.113); lag 3 (RR=1.053, 95%CI: 1.015 to 1.092); lag 4 (RR=1.043, 95%CI: 1.004 to 1.088) and lag 5 (RR=1.061, 95%CI: 1.018 to 1.106).
lag 2	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	A 10 microg/m increase in bushfire PM10 was associated with a 1.24% (95% confidence interval = 0.22% to 2.27%) increase in all respiratory disease admissions (at lag 0), a 3.80% (1.40% to 6.26%) increase in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admissions (at lag 2), and a 5.02% (1.77% to 8.37%) increase in adult asthma admissions (at lag 0).
TREM-1	colitis	We confirmed that inhibition of TREM-1 attenuates the severity of colitis at clinically, endoscopically and histologically levels.
TREM-1	colitis	Indeed, TREM-1 receptor and its signaling pathways contribute to the pathology of several non-infectious acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis, ischemia reperfusion-induced tissue injury, colitis, fibrosis and cancer.
Trem1	colitis	In CD4(+) T cell- and dextran sodium sulfate-induced models of colitis, Trem1(-/-) mice displayed significantly attenuated disease that was associated with reduced inflammatory infiltrates and diminished expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
TREM-1	colitis	In vivo, the treatment with the TREM-1 antagonist LP17 or control peptide was initiated at the beginning of or after induction of experimental colitis or colitis-associated tumorigenesis.
TREM-1	ulcerative colitis	In ulcerative colitis, sTREM-1 level was correlated more strongly with the endoscopic activity (r=0.498) than the C-reactive protein level (r=0.386) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (r=0.272), although not superior to the partial Mayo score (r=0.611).
TREM-1	ulcerative colitis	In ulcerative colitis, sTREM-1 level was correlated most closely with the endoscopic disease activity among serum biomarkers, but was not superior to the clinical activity index.
TREM-1	ulcerative colitis	Our results suggest that sTREM-1 level may represent a complementary marker for the assessment of endoscopic activity in ulcerative colitis, but not in Crohn's disease.
TREM-1	colitis	Intestinal biopsies and concurrently collected sera from patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC) enrolled in the Swiss IBD cohort study were analyzed for intestinal TREM-1 mRNA and serum sTREM-1 expression.
TREM-1	colitis	Serum sTREM-1 and TREM-1 mRNA expression levels were further determined in sera and colonic tissues collected at various time-points post disease induction in an experimental mouse model of colitis and correlated with disease activity.
TREM-1	ulcerative colitis	Three TREM-1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs2234237, rs3789205, and rs9471535) were genotyped by Taqman technology on 202 Crohn's disease (CD), 265 ulcerative colitis (UC), 138 with intestinal Behcet's disease (BD), and 234 healthy controls and the relationships between these SNPs and IBD development and phenotypes were evaluated.
TREM-1	ulcerative colitis	However, TREM-1 SNPs were not significantly associated with the development of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.
PDE4B	diffuse large B cell lymphoma	Stable expression of miR-124 in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines diminished PDE4B expression.
PDE4B	diffuse large B-cell lymphoma	Starting from the GSEA, we found that overexpression of the PDE4B in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) impinge on the same genes/pathways that are abnormally active in GC-resistant tumors.
MPC-1	plasmacytoma	On the basis of biopsies of the masses in the pharynx and finger, he was diagnosed with extramedullary plasmablastic plasmacytoma, with somewhat immature CD45(+), MPC-1(-), and CD49e(-).
MPC-1	plasmacytoma	Changes to CD45 negativity and MPC-1 partial positivity were seen, while CD49e negativity persisted, suggesting that the plasmablastic plasmacytoma had reverted to a more immature state.
MPC1	plasmacytoma	He had the following poor prognostic factors: 1) multiple extramedullary plasmacytomas, 2) massive myelomatous effusion, 3) increasing immature myeloma cells with plasmablastic morphology, and 4) predominance of MPC1-CD49e-CD45+ phenotype immature myeloma cells.
MPC-1	MGUS	Interestingly, the proportions of MPC-1(-) and MPC-1(-)CD45(+) immature monoclonal plasma cells also increased in the 7 progressive cases of MGUS.
LMN	muscular atrophy	The main hereditary LMNSs in adulthood are Kennedy's disease, late-onset spinal muscular atrophy and distal hereditary motor neuropathies.
LMN	muscular atrophy	In contrast, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) involves the specific degeneration of LMNs, with symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy.
LMN	muscular atrophy	Targeting lower motor neurons (LMNs) for gene delivery could be useful for disorders such as spinal muscular atrophy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
KCa3.1	thoracic aortic aneurysm	Our previous study showed that reduction of KCa3.1 channel expression by lyso-globotriaosylceramide (lyso-Gb3) inhibits differentiation into myofibroblasts and collagen synthesis, which might lead to development of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm secondary to Fabry disease.
KCa3.1	thoracic aortic aneurysm	Moreover, lyso-Gb3 suppressed expression of class II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase C2Beta (PI3KC2Beta) by PKA activation, which reduces the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P], and the reduced membrane surface expression of KCa3.1 channel was recovered by increasing the intracellular levels of PI(3)P. Consequently, our findings that lyso-Gb3 inhibited both KCa3.1 channel synthesis and surface expression by increasing intracellular cAMP, and controlled surface expression through changes in PI3KC2Beta-mediated PI(3)P production, suggest that modulation of PKA and PI3KC2Beta activity to control of KCa3.1 channel expression can be an alternative important target to attenuate ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms in Fabry disease.
KCa3.1	thoracic aortic aneurysm	These findings suggest that the KCa3.1 channel can serve as a new target to attenuate and prevent development of ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm in Fabry disease.
ZNF507	autism	We sequenced BCAs in patients with autism or related NDDs, revealing disruption of 33 loci in four general categories: (1) genes previously associated with abnormal neurodevelopment (e.g., AUTS2, FOXP1, and CDKL5), (2) single-gene contributors to microdeletion syndromes (MBD5, SATB2, EHMT1, and SNURF-SNRPN), (3) novel risk loci (e.g., CHD8, KIRREL3, and ZNF507), and (4) genes associated with later-onset psychiatric disorders (e.g., TCF4, ZNF804A, PDE10A, GRIN2B, and ANK3).

CYLD	cylindroma	A predisposition to multiple cylindromas is seen in patients with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome, who carry germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene CYLD.
CYLD	cylindroma	Previous studies of inherited cylindromas have highlighted the frequent presence of bi-allelic truncating CYLD mutations as a recurrent driver mutation.
CYLD	cylindroma	Here, we investigated inherited cylindromas from several families with germline CYLD mutations for the presence of MYB activation.
CYLD	Cylindroma	Cylindroma is a rare skin tumour that is inherited in several skin-tumour syndromes caused by germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene, CYLD.
CYLD	cylindroma	The aims of this study were to perform a whole-exome sequencing analysis of a breast cylindroma and to investigate the role of molecular analyses in the differentiation between breast cylindroma, a benign tumour that displays MYB expression, and CYLD gene mutations, and its main differential diagnosis, the breast solid-basaloid adenoid cystic carcinoma, a malignant tumour that is characterized by the presence of the MYB-NFIB fusion gene and MYB overexpression.
CYLD	cylindroma	The clinical presentation of multiple, rare, skin appendage tumours called cylindromas has been attributed to germline mutations in the tumour suppressor gene CYLD (OMIM 605018).
familial cylindromatosis	cylindroma	Brooke-Spiegler Syndrome (BSS), familial cylindromatosis (FC) and multiple familial trichoepitheliomas (MFT) (OMIM #605041, #132700, #601606 respectively) differ due to the types of other skin appendage tumour seen together with cylindroma, such as spiradenoma and trichoepithelioma.
familial cylindromatosis	cylindroma	Unique tumors included a cutaneous cylindroma invasive of skull convexity occurring in familial cylindromatosis and a ganglioneuroma of the middle ear with massive bilateral skull base extension.
AXT	neuropathy	This review will examine and extrapolate from the recent literature to build support for the use of AXT in mitigating neuropathy in normal aging and neurodegenerative disease.
TAG-1	neuropathy	We investigated frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the candidate genes protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22), B-cell scaffold protein with ankyrin repeats (BANK1), B lymphocyte kinase (Blk), and Fc gamma receptor class IIB (FCGR2B), which have been found to be associated with other autoimmune diseases, CD1A and CD1E, important for antigen presentation of glycolipids, and transient axonal glycoprotein 1 (TAG-1), which is associated with responsiveness to intravenous immunoglobulin in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
A-XT	exotropia	To investigate the clinical features of A-pattern exotropia and to evaluate the efficacy of surgical treatment for the correction of A-pattern exotropia (A-XT).
CAMOS	optic atrophy	We identified 10 patients from three CA and from two GMS families with WDR73 mutations including the original family described with CA, mental retardation, optic atrophy, and skin abnormalities (CAMOS).
CAMOS	optic atrophy	CAMOS (Cerebellar Ataxia with Mental retardation, Optic atrophy and Skin abnormalities) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by a nonprogressive congenital cerebellar ataxia associated with mental retardation, optic atrophy, and skin abnormalities.
MSE -1	refractive error	Eyes with laser-treated threshold ROP had significant myopia at both ages (mean spherical equivalent [MSE] in right eye at both refractions -0.72, -1.21 diopters [D]), astigmatism (MSE -1.62, -1.80 D), and anisometropia (MSE 0.82, 1.02 D; ANOVA p &lt; 0.05), and increased refractive errors across ages (paired t test p &lt; 0.05).
GluRs	amblyopia	Monocular deprivation does affect the binding parameters (KD and Bmax) of GluRs, which may be a molecular mechanism of the development of amblyopia.
GluRs	glaucoma	Expressions of GluRs and CaBPs (i.e., parvalbumin and calbindin D-28k) were observed to be increased in the retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner nuclear layer (INL) at 3 days and 1 week after the onset of glaucoma.
GluRs	glaucoma	The finding that both NMDA and non-NMDA GluRs were involved in glutamate-induced excitotoxicity suggests that isolated pig RGCs provide a good model for glaucoma.
USP45	XPF	USP45 associates with ERCC1, a subunit of the DNA repair endonuclease XPF-ERCC1, via a short acidic motif outside of the USP45 catalytic domain.
USP45	XPF	Finally, USP45 localises to sites of DNA damage in a manner dependent on its deubiquitylase activity, but independent of its ability to bind ERCC1-XPF.
USP45	XPF	Together, these results establish USP45 as a new regulator of XPF-ERCC1 crucial for efficient DNA repair.
KLF4	myotonic dystrophy type 1	We used a polycistronic lentiviral vector (hSTEMCCA-loxP) encoding OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and cMYC genes and containing loxP sites, excisible by Cre recombinase, to reprogram patient-specific fetal cells derived from prenatal diagnosis for several genetic disorders, such as myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), Beta-thalassemia (Beta-Thal), lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome (LDS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), cystic fibrosis (CF), as well as from wild-type (WT) fetal cells.
DEFA1	asthma	Twelve CpG loci (11 genes) showed greater than 10% comparative difference in DNA methylation, including hyper-methylated loci of FAM181A, MRI1, PIWIL1, CHFR, DEFA1, MRPL28, AURKA, and hypo-methylated loci of NALP1L5, MAP8KIP3, ACAT2, and PM20D1 in maternal asthma.
DEFA1	asthma	Systemic expression of DEFA1,1B,3,4,CTSG and ELA2 was significantly higher in the neutrophilic asthma (NA) phenotype.
UGT1A	cholelithiasis	The objective of this study was to determine the combined influence of alpha thalassemia, fetal hemoglobin, and the UGT1A1 polymorphism on serum bilirubin levels and cholelithiasis in patients with sickle cell disease.
UGT1A	cholelithiasis	The present study investigated the role of several genetic factors (UGT1A1 promoter (TA)n repeat polymorphism, alpha-globin status), hematological parameters, clinical severity, and hydroxyurea (HU) therapy on the occurrence of cholelithiasis in SCD.
UGT1A	cholelithiasis	We confirmed that alpha-thalassemia and low basal reticulocyte (RET) count were independent protective factors for cholelithiasis while 7/7, 8/8 and 7/8 UGT1A1 (TA)n genotypes were independent predisposing factors for this complication.
UGT1A	cholelithiasis	We explored the potential relationship between steady state serum bilirubin levels and the incidence of cholelithiasis in the context of UGT1A1 gene A(TA)nTAA promoter polymorphism in Omani sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients, homozygotes for African (Benin and Bantu) and Arab-Indian Beta(S) haplotypes, but sharing the same microgeographical environment and comparable life style factors.
UGT1A	cholelithiasis	Thus, not cholelithiasis but total serum bilirubin was influenced by UGT1A1 polymorphism in this SCA cohort.
UGT1A	cholelithiasis	Altogether our data provide the implication of UGT1A1 and SLCO1A2 in sickle cell anemia-related cholelithiasis.
UGT1A	cholelithiasis	Present study was aimed to explore the effect of (TA)n UGT1A1 gene promoter polymorphism on bilirubin metabolism, bilirubinaemia, predisposition to cholelithiasis and subsequent cholecystectomy, in Sickle-Cell Anemia (SCA) and beta-Thalasemia major (bTH) in Kuwaiti subjects compared to other population.
UGT1A	cholelithiasis	Our results confirm UGT1A1 (TA)7 allele as one of the factors accounting for the hyperbilirubinemia and cholelithiasis observed in SCA and bTH.
UGT1A	cholelithiasis	We analyzed the polymorphism A(TA)nTAA at the UGT1A1 promoter and the relationships between the various A(TA)nTAA genotypes and alleles and bilirubin levels and occurrence of cholelithiasis.
UGT1A	cholelithiasis	We analyzed the polymorphism A(TA)&lt;formula&gt;_{n}&lt;/formula&gt; TAA at the UGT1A1 promoter and the relationships between the various A(TA)&lt;formula&gt;_{n}&lt;/formula&gt; TAA genotypes and alleles and bilirubin levels and occurrence of cholelithiasis.
ART3	azoospermia	The ADP-ribosyltransferase 3 gene (ART3) has been reported to be associated with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) in the Japanese population.
ART3	azoospermia	A recent Japanese study provided evidence that the rs6836703: G&gt;A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) from the ADP-ribosyltransferase 3 (ART3) gene is significantly associated with non-obstructive azoospermia.
SPTB	hereditary spherocytosis	The analysis of genes involved in hereditary spherocytosis, by next-generation sequencing in two patients with clinical diagnosis of the disease, showed the presence of the c.1795+1G&gt;A mutation in the SPTB gene.
SPTB	Hereditary spherocytosis	Hereditary spherocytosis stems from mutations in one of the genes encoding ankyrin-1 (ANKI), alpha spectrin (SPTA1) and beta spectrin (SPTB), the anion exchanger 1 (SLC4A 1), and protein 4.2 (EPB42).
SPTB	hereditary spherocytosis	We also investigated methylation profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with red cell membrane diseases, such as complete protein 4.2 deficiency due to ELB42 mutations, hereditary spherocytosis with EPB3 mutations, and hereditary elliptocytosis with SPTB mutations.
SPTB	hereditary spherocytosis	The mutations of most cases of hereditary spherocytosis (HS) are located in the following genes: ANK1, SPTB, SLC4A1, EPB42 and SPTA1, which encode ankyrin, spectrin beta-chain, the anion exchanger 1 (band 3), protein 4.2 and spectrin alpha-chain, respectively.
bone morphogenetic protein 1	osteogenesis imperfecta	Mutations in bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) in humans or deletion of BMP1 and related protease tolloid like 1 (TLL1) in mice lead to osteogenesis imperfecta (OI).
bone morphogenetic protein-1	osteogenesis imperfecta	Mutations in the proteinase bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1) were recently identified in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, which can be associated with type 1 dentinogenesis imperfecta.
BMP1	osteogenesis imperfecta	We previously showed these mice to have a skeletal phenotype that includes elements of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), osteomalacia, and deficient osteocyte maturation, observations validated by the finding of BMP1 mutations in a subset of human patients with OI-like phenotypes.
BMP1	osteogenesis imperfecta	Autosomal recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) accounts for 10% of all OI cases, and, currently, mutations in 10 genes (CRTAP, LEPRE1, PPIB, SERPINH1, FKBP10, SERPINF1, SP7, BMP1, TMEM38B, and WNT1) are known to be responsible for this form of the disease.
Isolated 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency	3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency	Isolated 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (3MCCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of leucine metabolism biochemically characterized by accumulation of 3-methylcrotonylglycine (3MCG), 3-methylcrotonic acid (3MCA) and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid.
MCCC2	autosomal recessive disorder	Isolated 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of leucine metabolism caused by mutations in MCCC1 or MCCC2 encoding the Alfa and Beta subunit of MCC, respectively.
ZIC2	polydactyly	We performed mutational analysis in the four main HPE causing genes (SHH, SIX3, TGIF, and ZIC2) and GLI3, a gene associated with polydactyly as well as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to search for microdeletions in these genes and two candidate HPE genes (DISP1 and FOXA2).
CCK-1	pancreatic cancer	Although the CCK-1 receptor has been shown to be highly expressed in resected human pancreatic cancer samples, its role is less clear.
CCK-1	pancreatic adenocarcinoma	The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the CCK-1 receptor expression and the function of the CCK-CCK-1 receptor pathway in the human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line, Mia PaCa-2.
CCK1	pancreatic tumor	However, the main source of CCK receptors in the pancreatic tumor samples consisted of CCK2-expressing islets and/or CCK1-expressing nerves rather than neoplastic tissue.
CCK1	pancreatic tumor	These data indicate that the presence of CCK receptors in human ductal pancreatic tumor samples is mainly due to CCK2 expression in residual pancreatic islets and CCK1 in pancreatic nerves.
TCN2	cleft lip	The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of the polymorphisms in TCN2 (rs1801198) gene and in MTRR (rs1801394) gene with nonsyndromic cleft lip and/or palate (NSCL/P) in a Brazilian population.
GluN2B	stroke	While the roles of the GluN2A and GluN2B subunit in ischemic stroke have been well developed, the role of the GluN2C subunit in ischemia is not well understood.
NR2B	ischemia	In the Western blotting assay, clonidine treatment led to significant up-regulation of the expression level of NR2B and Phospho-NR2B in the hippocampus of the rats when compared with the cerebral ischemia group.
NR2B	ischemia	In conclusion, clonidine could improve the learning and memory ability of rats with cerebral ischemia, and NR2B, ERK1/2, CREB, NF-KB were involved in this effect.
GluN2B	systemic lupus erythematosus	DWEYS-IgG cross-reactive with DNA and the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits GluN2A/GluN2B has been associated with neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE).
NR2B	neurodegenerative disease	Therefore, NMDAR antagonists, especially NR2B-selective ones, combined with IGF-1 may serve as an alternative therapeutic agent for oxidative stress related neurodegenerative disease.
NR2B	stroke	Taken together, our results demonstrated that LBP is neuroprotective against ischemic injury by its dual roles in activation of NR2A and inhibition of NR2B signaling pathways, which suggests that LBP may be a superior therapeutic candidate for targeting glutamate excitotoxicity for the treatment of ischemic stroke.
CD11b	obesity	The obesity-induced changes in adipose tissue macrophage numbers are mainly due to increases in the triple-positive CD11b+ F4/80+ CD11c+ adipose tissue macrophage subpopulation.
Itgam	obesity	Contrary to our hypothesis that obesity-mediated white AT inflammation is Nlrp3-dependent, we found that Western diet-induced expression of AT inflammatory markers (i.e., Cd68, Cd11c, Emr1, Itgam, Lgals, Il18, Mcp1, Tnf, Ccr2, Ccl5 mRNAs, and Mac-2 protein) were not accompanied by increased caspase-1 cleavage, a hallmark feature of NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
PIN-4	carcinoma	In current practice, an antibody cocktail comprising p63, CK903, and AMACR (PIN-4 cocktail) is frequently utilized to evaluate foci suspicious for prostatic adenocarcinoma.
PIN-4	prostate cancer	Only 2 NA cases displayed an overall PIN-4 staining pattern compatible with prostate cancer.
PIN-4	prostate cancer	Although heterogenous staining patterns were seen within individual cases, use of the PIN-4 cocktail effectively discriminates NA from prostate cancer because of the high frequency of coexpression of AMACR and CK903 within NA.
PIN-4	prostate cancer	Kidney and prostate cancer tumor and benign biopsies were stained with hemotoxylin and eosin and prostate biopsies were subjected to PIN-4 immunohistochemistry.
PIN4	cancer	A subset of biopsy sections was analyzed by IHC, and cancerous and non-cancerous regions could be readily visualized by PIN4 staining.
Ang-2	thrombocytopenia	Elevated serum levels of Ang-2 and high values for the Ang-2/Ang-1 ratio may potentially be used as predictors of worst-case prognoses for P. vivax malaria, especially in patients with thrombocytopenia.
angiopoietin-2	thrombocytopenia	Dengue-associated thrombocytopenia and endothelial activation are associated with an imbalance in angiopoietin-2: angiopoietin-1 plasma levels.
RGR	retinitis pigmentosa	It has been previously reported that mutations in retinal G protein coupled receptor (RGR) are associated with retinitis pigmentosa.
RGR	retinal disease	The present study aims to systemically analyze the potential role of variants of RGR in retinal diseases.
RGR	retinal disorder	These data suggest that the recessive retinal disorder previously reported to be due to homozygous mutation in RGR is, at least in part, due to variants in CDHR1 and that the true consequences of RGR knock-out on human retinal structure and function are yet to be determined.
RGR	retinitis pigmentosa	Rare mutations in the human RGR gene lead to autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa or dominantly inherited peripapillary choroidal atrophy.
RGR	age-related macular degeneration	In Western blot assays, the RGR-d protein was detected in retinas of a large proportion ( approximately 53%) of individual donors, including patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
RGR	retinitis pigmentosa	Mutations in the human gene encoding RGR are associated with retinitis pigmentosa.
ELN	Leukemia	In recognition of the clinical significance of AML MRD, the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recently recommended the establishment of CR-MRDNegative as a separate category of treatment response.
ELN	Leukemia	The distribution according to the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) risk categorization from 2010 was 20% favorable, 31% intermediate-1, 28% intermediate-2, and 21% adverse.
ELN	Leukemia	Patients were stratified using the ELN European Leukemia Net classification.
elastin	cancer	oH(E)mT-DCN treatment also attenuated the expression of major ECM components, such as collagen I/III, elastin and fibronectin and induced tumor cell apoptosis, leading to extensive viral dispersion within orthotopic pancreatic tumors and pancreatic cancer patient-derived tumor spheroids.
neuronal nuclei	transient cerebral ischemia	In this study, we firstly examined neuroprotective effects of pre- or post-treatment with 15 and 30 mg/kg ATX against ischemic damage in the gerbil hippocampal cornus ammonis 1 (CA1) region subjected to 5 min of transient cerebral ischemia using cresyl violet staining, neuronal nuclei immunohistochemistry and Fluoro-J B histofluorescence staining.
cystatins	inverted papilloma	Dysregulation of cysteinyl cathepsins and their inhibitors, cystatins (stefins), were implied in progression of tumorgenesis; nevertheless, their role in sinonasal inverted papilloma (IP) is still unrecognized.
Mdr2	Pkd2	Despite fundamental limitations applying to these models, such as the distinct immune system and the different metabolism regulating liver homeostasis in rodents when compared to humans, multiple approaches, such as surgery (bile duct ligation), chemical-induced (3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine, DDC, Alfa-naphthylisothiocyanate, ANIT), viral infections (Rhesus rotavirustype A, RRV-A), and genetic manipulation (Mdr2, Cftr, Pkd1, Pkd2, Prkcsh, Sec63, Pkhd1) have been developed.
PFIC3	autosomal recessive disorder	Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) is an autosomal recessive disorder of cholestasis of hepatocellular origin, typically seen in infancy or childhood caused by a defect in the ABCB4 located on chromosome 7.
ABCB4	lamellar ichthyosis	For example, mutations in ABCA1 cause Tangier disease associated with defective efflux of cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine from the plasma membrane to the lipid acceptor protein apoA1 (apolipoprotein AI), mutations in ABCA3 cause neonatal surfactant deficiency associated with a loss in secretion of the lipid pulmonary surfactants from lungs of newborns, mutations in ABCA4 cause Stargardt macular degeneration, a retinal degenerative disease linked to the reduced clearance of retinoid compounds from photoreceptor cells, mutations in ABCA12 cause harlequin and lamellar ichthyosis, skin diseases associated with defective lipid trafficking in keratinocytes, and mutations in ABCB4 and ABCG5/ABCG8 are responsible for progressive intrafamilial hepatic disease and sitosterolaemia associated with defective phospholipid and sterol transport respectively.
IGF2BP2	cancer	We further analyze two independent breast cancer datasets and find that specific isoforms of IGF2BP2, NECTIN4, ITGB6, and KLHDC9 are significantly associated with AZD6244, lapatinib, erlotinib, and paclitaxel, respectively.
IGF2BP2	glioma	RT-qPCR and Spearman's correlation analysis were then performed to measure IGF2BP2 mRNA expression in clinical glioma tissues and its correlation with miR-188 expression.
IGF2BP2	glioma	Finally, the biological roles of IGF2BP2 in glioma cells were assessed.
IGF2BP2	glioma	The present study identified IGF2BP2 as a direct target of miR-188 in glioma, and IGF2BP2 under-expression served tumour-suppressive roles in glioma growth and metastasis.
IGF2BP2	glioma	Thus, miR-188 had a similar role in glioma by inhibiting the action of its downstream target, IGF2BP2.
IGF2BP2	cancer	Background: Serum autoantibodies against tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) are detectable in early-stage gastric cancer patients; however, the time point during cancerogenesis when they appear in circulation is still obscure.Methods: In this study, we developed a recombinant antigen microarray and analyzed the prevalence of autoantibodies against 102 TAAs in 829 gastric cancer patients and 929 healthy controls from Caucasian and Asian populations, as well as 100 patients with chronic atrophic gastritis and 775 individuals staged according to different grades of intestinal metaplasia.Results: Six antigens, including CTAG1B/CTAG2, DDX53, IGF2BP2, TP53, and MAGEA3, were predominantly reacting with sera from gastric cancer patients when compared with healthy controls, and the seroreactivity was associated with intestinal-type gastric cancer, but not with patients' Helicobacter pylori status, grade, age, gender, or stage of gastric cancer.
IMP2	cancer	The gene encoding the Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2/IMP2 is amplified and overexpressed in many human cancers, accompanied by a poorer prognosis.
IMP2	cancer	Herein we show in a diverse array of human cancer cells that IMP2 overexpression stimulates and IMP2 elimination diminishes proliferation by 50-80%.
IMP2	cancer	IMP2 stabilization of HMGA1 mRNA plus IMP2 stimulated IGF2 production synergistically drive cancer cell proliferation and account for IMP2's tumor promoting action.
IGF2BP2	cancer	In conclusion, miR-1193 suppressed proliferation and invasion of human breast cancer cells via translational suppression of IGF2BP2.
HTRP5	megalocornea	New genes HTRP5, CAPN6, STPK, 14-3-3PKR, and CALM1 and previously known genes including BTK, DDP, GLA, PLP, COL4A5, COL4A6, PAK3, and DCX are localized; candidate loci for other disorders for which genes have not yet been identified, including DFN-2, POF, megalocornea, and syndromic and nonsyndromic mental retardation, are also mapped in the region.
RASSF7	goiter	To study the expression status of Ras-association domain family 7 (RASSF7) and Ras-association domain family 8 (RASSF8) in nodular thyroid goiter (NTG), medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and establish whether a correlation exists between the presence of RASSF7 and RASSF8 proteins and clinicopathological parameters of the disease.
MyoD	ischemia	Moreover, HO-1 diminished ischemia-induced expression of MyoD involved in satellite cell differentiation in HO-1 KO mice.
CD9	Glanzmann thrombasthenia	Coprecipitation of CD36, CD9, and alpha6beta1 was also observed on platelets from a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia, indicating that alphaII(b)beta3 is not required for the other proteins to associate.
CD9	Glanzmann's thrombasthenia	To rule out a cross-reactivity of the two polyclonal antibodies with GPIIb/IIIa, we studied PECAM1 and CD9 expression on the platelets from a patient with type I Glanzmann's thrombasthenia whose platelets are devoid of GPIIb/IIIa.
SLC5A6	cancer	In contrast to TASK-1, which was not differentially expressed in lung cancer vs. normal lung tissue, we found the Na+-coupled nutrient transporters, SLC5A3, SLC5A6, and SLC38A1, transporters for myo-inositol, biotin and glutamine, respectively, to be significantly overexpressed in lung adenocarcinomas.
sodium dependent multivitamin transporter	cancer	qPCR analysis showed elevated expression of efflux transporters (P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistant protein 2, breast cancer resistant protein) and influx transporters (folate receptor-Alfa, cationic and neutral amino acid transporter, sodium dependent multivitamin transporter) in a time dependent manner.
sodium dependent multivitamin transporter	cancer	Immunoblot analysis further confirmed elevated expression of breast cancer resistant protein and sodium dependent multivitamin transporter.
sodium dependent multivitamin transporter	cancer	All these studies demonstrated for the first time the functional and molecular expression of sodium dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT), a specific carrier-mediated system for biotin uptake, in human derived breast cancer (T47D) cells.
sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter	retinoblastoma	The overall objective of this study was to investigate the differential expression of folate receptor-alpha (FR-Alfa), sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT), and amino acid transporter [B ((0, +))] in retinoblastoma (Y-79) and retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells.
SMVT	retinoblastoma	This work demonstrated for the first time the higher expression and affinity of FR-Alfa, SMVT, and B ((0, +)) mRNA levels in retinoblastoma (Y-79) cells compared with retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells.
sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter	cancer	To synthesize a novel camptothecin-poly(ethylene glycol) conjugate (CPT-PEG) which includes biotin as a moiety to enhance nonspecific and/or targeted uptake via the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) and to evaluate its anticancer activity and apoptosis induction.
SMVT	cancer	This suggests that the targeting approach utilizing transporters such as SMVT may substantially improve the delivery of CPT and its anticancer activity by enhancing cellular permeability and possibly retention of CPT.
SMVT	placental choriocarcinoma	We have cloned the human Na+-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT), which transports the water-soluble vitamins pantothenate, biotin, and lipoate, from a placental choriocarcinoma cell line (JAR).
IL-16	cutaneous T cell lymphoma	While the association between IL-16 plasma levels and tumor progression has been reported for many types of cancer, the mechanism for IL-16 involvement has been partially elucidated for three of the cancer types, cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), multiple myeloma (MM), and breast cancer.
pro-interleukin-16	Sezary syndrome	Nuclear translocation of pro-interleukin-16 was not observed in late stages of Sezary syndrome, indicating this loss is not reversible.
IL-16	Sezary syndrome	We propose that it is feasible to use plasma levels of IL-16 as a potential diagnostic marker of Sezary syndrome and to use loss of intracellular IL-16 as a prognostic indicator of disease severity and stage.
interleukin-16	mycosis fungoides	By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, interleukin-16 mRNA was detected in 18 of 18 mycosis fungoides lesions investigated.
interleukin-16	mycosis fungoides	Given the biologic properties of interleukin-16 and the parallel activation of the interleukin-2/CD25 pathway, interleukin-16 might be involved in the recruitment and stimulation of CD4+ lymphocytes in mycosis fungoides lesions and therefore contribute to the perpetuation of the associated cutaneous inflammation.
parathyroid hormone	adenoma	Three additional patients with possible parathyroid adenomas at 11C-choline PET/CT were ultimately found to have thyroid lesions on the basis of tissue diagnosis; however, none of these patients had abnormal calcium or parathyroid hormone levels.
parathyroid hormone	adenoma	Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism generally have a single parathyroid adenoma that causes excessive excretion of parathyroid hormone.
parathyroid hormone	adenoma	Although double adenomas are not yet widely acknowledged, presurgical imaging and nuclear scans can help to localize multiple lesions, and intraoperative parathyroid hormone assays can confirm the diagnosis and cure.
CCNA1	multiple myeloma	Finally, MMGP analysis revealed a positive correlation between the transcript levels of B7-H4 and proliferation-related genes including MKI67, CCNA1, and Myc in several patients with multiple myeloma.
cyclin A1	myelodysplastic syndrome	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of cyclin A1 mRNA in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and its clinical significance.
cyclin A1	essential thrombocythemia	Cyclin A1 mRNA was detectable in 11 of 11 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, three of three patients with acute biphenotypic leukemia, eight of eight patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, 59 of 69 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) at diagnosis, 13 of 15 patients with CML in blastic transformation, 10 of 18 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, two of nine patients with essential thrombocythemia, and only two of 10 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with both cyclin A1 RT-PCR positive ALL leukemias being undifferentiated relapses.
p53	ANP	Mice with ANP showed increased apoptosis of pancreatic acinar cells, pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity, serum lactate dehydrogenase activity, amylase, tumor necrosis factor-Alfa (TNF-Alfa), interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels as well as decreased serum IL-10 level, pancreatic expression of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and p53, but the ratio of acetylated HSF1 and p53 was markedly increased.
p53	ANP	These data suggest that resveratrol protects against L-arginine-induced ANP, which may be related to the enhancement of SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 and HSF1.
p53	acute pancreatitis	The aim of this study was to explore the role of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK)/p53 signaling pathway in injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier during severe acute pancreatitis (SAP).
ORC4	pulmonary emphysema	Furthermore, compared with homozygous missense mutations, compound heterozygous mutations appeared to have a more severe effect on phenotype, causing more severe growth retardation in ORC4 and more frequently pulmonary emphysema in CDT1.
HNRNPL	prostate cancer	We recently identified an RBP HNRNPL as a novel prostate cancer dependency via regulation of RNA splicing, suggesting the potential to target RBP or RBP-RNA interaction to treat cancer.
HNRNPL	prostate cancer	HNRNPL directly regulates the alternative splicing of a set of RNAs, including those encoding the androgen receptor, the key lineage-specific prostate cancer oncogene.
HNRNPL	prostate cancer	Collectively, our data reveal HNRNPL and its RNA clients as players in prostate cancer growth and potential therapeutic targets.
hnRNP-L	bladder cancer	Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP-L) is a promoter of various kinds of cancers, but its actions in bladder cancer (BC) are unclear.
HnRNP-L	prostate cancer	In this study, we examined the role of HnRNP-L in prostate cancer (Pca).
3- to 8	prostate cancer	These results suggest a rationale for dose reduction of doxorubicin and docetaxel in prostate cancer therapy, since the doses needed to achieve 50% cell death may be decreased by approximately 4- to 15-fold or 3- to 8-fold, respectively, after a pre-treatment with ciprofloxacin.
CA I	iron deficiency anemia	This study investigated the presence of CA I and II autoantibodies in patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA).
CAI	iron deficiency anemia	Compared with controls, CAIII concentration was lower in iron deficiency anemia (P&lt;0.01), but higher in beta-thalassemia anemia (P&lt;0.001).
CA-B	iron deficiency anemia	The levels of erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase isozymes (CA-B and CA-C) were determined by a quantitative immunochemical technique in order to elucidate their clinical significances in patients with iron deficiency anemia.
CA-B	iron deficiency anemia	1 The levels of erythrocyte CA-B per gram hemoglobin, CA-B per ml erythrocyte and CA-C per gram hemoglobin all increased but CA-C per ml erythrocyte did not increased in iron deficiency anemia.
CA-B	iron deficiency anemia	The content of CA-B synthesized in lysates was much higher than that of CA-C. 6 In iron deficiency anemia, the increase of erythrocyte CA is speculated to be compensatory mechanism, which brought about the transportation of CO2 and right shifts of O2 dissociation curve.
ITK	allergic asthma	Inhibition of inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, may represent a novel treatment for allergic asthma.
Itk	asthma	Here we show that Itk, a mediator of T cell receptor signalling required for Th2 immune responses and the development of asthma, is a positive regulator of Th9 differentiation.
ITK	asthma	Compared to wild-type mice, ITK knockout mice are resistant to asthma and exhibit reduced lung inflammation and decreased amounts of TH2-type cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
ITK	asthma	Unexpectedly, inhibition of the kinase activity of ITK during or after antigen rechallenge in an ovalbumin-induced mouse model of asthma failed to reduce airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation.
ITK	asthma	Thus, our studies predict that inhibition of the kinase activity of ITK may not be therapeutic in patients with asthma.
4 ppb	asthma	FeNO levels were significantly elevated in the asthma compared to the control group (26 +/- 18 versus 11 +/- 4 ppb; p &lt; 0.05), and trended higher than levels in the tetraplegia group (15 +/- 6; p = 0.08).
interleukin-2 inducible T-cell kinase	asthma	The medicinal chemistry community has directed considerable efforts toward the discovery of selective inhibitors of interleukin-2 inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), given its role in T-cell signaling downstream of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the implications of this target for inflammatory disorders such as asthma.
caspase-3	gestational trophoblastic neoplasia	The caspase-3 apoptotic index was a strong risk factor for subsequent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia development.

CI -20	penicillin allergy	Compared with patients with a false-positive penicillin allergy result (confirmed by negative penicillin skin testing result), patients reporting a true penicillin allergy confirmed by positive penicillin skin test results tended to be more frequently men (61.5% versus 44.5%; Delta 17.0%; 95% CI -13.5% to 42%), black (69.2% versus 44.5%; Delta 24.7%; 95% CI -6.9% to 46.8%), and have no family history of drug allergy (7.7% versus 17.5%; Delta9.8%; 95% CI -20.9% to 20.4%), but self-reported other drug allergies more frequently (61.5% versus 38.7%; Delta 22.9%; 95% CI -7.7% to 47.5%).
RAB24	IL7R	We identified 12 biomarkers consistently associated with either clinical groups "upstream" towards culture-positive TB on the TB disease spectrum (CD14, FCGR1A, FPR1, MMP9, RAB24, SEC14L1, and TIMP2) or "downstream" towards a decreased likelihood of TB disease (BLR1, CD3E, CD8A, IL7R, and TGFBR2), suggesting a correlation with MTB-related pathology and high relevance to a future POC test for pediatric TB.
class III Beta-tubulin	proliferative vitreoretinopathy	However, aberrant expression of class III Beta-tubulin has been observed in passaged RPE cells and RPE cells with dedifferentiated morphology in pathologic epiretinal membranes from idiopathic macular pucker, proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).
IFN-alpha	allergic rhinitis	Disorders in the ability ofleukocytes to produce IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma were detected in patients with bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis.
IFN-alpha	sinusitis	Factors underlying the 'exacerbation-prone' phenotype are incompletely understood but include extrinsic factors: cigarette smoking, medication non-compliance, psychosocial factors, and co-morbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, rhinosinusitis, obesity, and intolerance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications; as well as intrinsic factors such as deficient epithelial cell production of the anti-viral type I interferons (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta).
apolipoprotein A-I	pulmonary edema	These data indicate that therapeutic strategies using SAHPs targeting CD36, but not necessarily mimicking all apolipoprotein A-I functions, may be considered a possible new treatment approach for inflammation-induced ALI and pulmonary edema.
NFKBIZ	Crohn's disease	The enhanced expression of IL-17 that is observed in patients with Crohn's disease could act on intestinal fibroblasts to induce expression of transcription factor NFKBIZ and proinflammatory chemokine CXCL1.
DFNA3	DFNA8	In the majority of cases, autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss is postlingual and progressive, with the exception of hearing impairment in families in which the impairment is linked to DFNA3, DFNA8/12, and DFNA24, the novel locus described in this report.
pilar	keratoacanthoma	The morphological similarity and resemblance of keratin 1, 10, and 14 profiles, and p63 and Beta-catenin expression between mixed epidermal and inner root sheath hybrid cysts and keratoacanthomas suggests that hybrid cysts progressed to keratoacanthomas, and the cells from infundibular cells to inner root sheath cells of the pilar segment seem to be the origin of rat keratoacanthomas.
argininosuccinate lyase	argininemia	UCDs include a spectrum of enzyme deficiencies, namely n-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency (NAGS), carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency (CPS1), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC), argininosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASL), citrullinemia type I (ASS1), and argininemia (ARG).

LDHA	head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	In this study, we examined the relationship between the lactic acid concentration and expression of LDHA and GLUT1, which are related to the Warburg effect, in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
LDH-A	head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	We found that cetuximab downregulated lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) and inhibited glycolysis in cetuximab-sensitive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells in an HIF-1Alfa downregulation-dependent manner.
CALR3	hypertrophic cardiomyopathy	An Australian cohort of 252 unrelated familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients were screened for mutations in the Ca(2+) regulatory genes, sorcin (SRI), calstabin (FKBP1B), calsequestrin (CASQ2), phospholamban (PLN), sarcolipin (SLN), calreticulin (CALR3) and calmodulin (CALM).
Heat shock protein HSP 90-beta	hepatocellular carcinoma	The validated proteins contain the clinically used hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) biomarker alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and the reported biomarker candidates Heat shock protein HSP 90-beta (HSP90), fatty acid-binding protein, epidermal (FABP5) and alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (ADH4), which demonstrated the robustness of the strategy.
Hsp90Beta	hepatocellular carcinoma	In vivo, Hsp90Beta promoted VEGFRs and CD31 expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma tumor xenografts and was associated with increased tumor microvessel density.
Hsp90Beta	colon cancer	In this study we report an apparent synergy between TGF-Beta1 and Hsp90Beta in stimulating migratory behaviour of colon cancer cells when signalling occurs via AlfavBeta6 integrin as opposed to the canonical TGF-Beta1 pathway.
HSP90AB1	colorectal cancer	Our findings indicate that the C allele of the novel colorectal cancer-associated variant rs2282151 is associated with increased expression levels of HSP90AB1, which is expressed higher in colorectal tumor tissues than in normal tissues.
Hsp90Beta	GIST	Bortezomib induced internalization and degradation of c-KIT by binding c-KIT to Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, and the subsequent release of Apaf-1, which was originally bound to the c-KIT-Hsp90Beta-Apaf-1 complex, induced primary apoptosis in GIST-T1 cells.
HSP90Beta	colon cancer	Both Annexin A1 and HSP90Beta were GlcNAcylated, and their protein expressions were elevated in colon cancer, compared to normal tissues.
HSP90Beta	colon cancer	Moreover, specific changes of GlcNAc abundances in Annexin A1 and HSP90Beta suggested that tumor-specific glycan patterns could serve as candidate biomarkers of colon cancer for distinguishing cancer patients from healthy individuals.
PEPCK	hepatoma	In addition, the knockdown of PEPCK, which is the rate-limiting enzyme for gluconeogenesis, led to a reduction in glucose production in rat hepatoma H4IIEC3 cells.
CXCR3	T-cell leukemia	We recently reported expression of the chemokine receptors CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) and CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and showed a preferential expression of CCR4 and its association with an unfavorable outcome.
TOMM20	cancer	We present a review of the current knowledge on cellular metabolism in non-cancerous and cancerous thyroid tissues, focusing on the monocarboxylate transporters MCT1 and MCT4, and on a transporter of the outer mitochondrial membrane TOMM20.
TOMM20	thyroid cancer	Papillary thyroid cancer and FA thyrocytes had high staining for TOMM20 compared to NCT and nodular goiter (NG) (P &lt; 0.01).
TOMM20	thyroid cancer	Staining patterns of MCT1 and TOMM20 in 35 human thyroid samples (15 ATC, 12 papillary thyroid cancer [PTC], and eight non-cancerous thyroid) and nine ATC mouse orthotopic xenografts were assessed by visual and Aperio digital scoring.
TOMM20	cancer	TOMM20 is also highly expressed in both ATC and PTC compared to non-cancerous thyroid tissue (P&lt;.01 for both).
TOMM20	cancer	High MCT1 and TOMM20 expression is also found in ATC mouse xenograft tumors compared to non-cancerous thyroid tissue (P&lt;.001).
TOMM20	cancer	ATC has metabolic features that distinguish it from PTC and non-cancerous thyroid tissue, including high expression of MCT1 and TOMM20.
TOMM20	cancer	PTC has low expression of MCT1 and non-cancerous thyroid tissue has low expression of both MCT1 and TOMM20.
TRPV2	prostate cancer	AM can induce a metastatic phenotype in prostate cancer cells through its action on TRPV2 calcium channels and is also capable of influencing localised levels of RANKL in the bone to favour tumourigenesis.
VRL	retinal lymphoma	To determine the profiles of soluble cytokine receptors and cytokines, including mostly their ligands, in the vitreous humor of patients with B-cell vitreoretinal lymphoma (VRL) and uveitis.
VRL	retinal lymphoma	In analyses in patients with VRL, elevation of sVEGFR1 and sVEGFR2 levels was more prominent in patients with systemic metastatic retinal lymphoma (SMRL) than in those with primary VRL/primary central nervous system lymphoma (PVRL/PCNSL).
TRPV2	prostate cancer	For example in prostate cancer cells, the TRPV2 activation following lysophospholipid or adrenomedullin stimulation enhances the invasiveness of cancer cells; furthermore, the increased malignancy of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells was associated with enhanced TRPV2 expression, mainly in metastatic prostate cancer cells.
TRPV2	bladder cancer	In this regard, bladder cancer tumors show loss or reduction of a short TRPV2 variant during cancer progression, with increased malignancy and invasiveness.
TRPV2	bladder cancer	TRPV2 and TRPM7 expression levels and TRPV2 activator-induced intracellular Ca(2+) increases were significantly higher, whereas TRPV4 expression and TRPV4 activator-induced intracellular Ca(2+) increases were significantly lower in mouse bladder cancer (MBT-2) cells compared to normal mouse urothelial cells.
TRPV2	bladder cancer	Increases in the expression of TRPV2 mRNA, immunoreactivity, and TRPV2 activator-induced intracellular Ca(2+) were also observed in T24 human bladder cancer cells.
TRPV2	bladder cancer	These results suggested that TRPV2 and TRPM7 were functionally expressed in bladder cancer cells and served as negative regulators of bladder cancer cell proliferation, most likely to prevent excess mechanical stresses.
TRPV2	prostate cancer	On the other hand, in prostate cancer cells, Ca2+-dependent activation of TRPV2 induced by lysophospholipids increases the invasion of tumor cells.
TRPV2	prostate cancer	In addition, the progression of prostate cancer to the castration-resistant phenotype is characterized by de novo TRPV2 expression, with higher TRPV2 transcript levels in patients with metastatic cancer.
TRPV2	bladder cancer	The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of TRPV2 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of 5637 bladder cancer cells in vitro.
TRPV2	bladder cancer	Rat TRPV2 cDNA was transfected into 5637 bladder cancer cells and changes in the behavior of the cells were detected.
TRPV2	bladder cancer	It was observed that TRPV2 enhanced bladder cancer cell migration and invasion; however, it did not affect cell proliferation in vitro.
TRPV2	bladder carcinoma	The results of this study suggest that TRPV2 channels are a potential therapeutic target for bladder carcinoma.
TRPV2	bladder cancer	The Transient Receptor Potential channel TRPV2 is known to promote in prostate cancer cell migration and invasive phenotype and is correlated with the stage and grade of bladder cancer.
TRPV2	prostate cancer	Initial studies showed that expression profile of some TRP channels, notably TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM8), TRP vanilloid 6 (TRPV6),TRP canonical (TRPC6) and TRPV2, is changing during the development and the progression of prostate cancer towards the hormone-refractory stages.
TRPV2	bladder cancer	The expression of TRPV2 mRNA in bladder cancer cell lines (T24, a poorly differentiated UC cell line and RT4, a well-differentiated UC cell line) was analyzed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
Shh	colorectal cancer	Furthermore, the effects of resveratrol and Shh on human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells were in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
Shh	colon cancer	Furthermore, knockdown of PFTK1 suppressed the expression of Shh as well as Smo, Ptc, and Gli-1 in colon cancer cells.
Sonic hedgehog	colon cancer	Taken together, these results suggest that knockdown of PFTK1 inhibited the proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells as well as the EMT progress by suppressing the Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway.
alpha-fetoprotein	renal agenesis	This case illustrates the potential severity of the renal anomalies in the BOR syndrome and the inadequacy of oligohydramnios and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein as screening methods for renal agenesis.
proton pump	thrombocytopenia	Severe sepsis and antibiotic use were both associated with moderate thrombocytopenia, and proton pump inhibitor use was statistically significant in both univariate and multivariate analysis.
proton pump	Thrombocytopenia	Thrombocytopenia is associated with poor prognosis, and the association between moderate thrombocytopenia and proton pump inhibitor use is relatively novel and should be validated in prospective studies.
SEC14L1	IL7R	We identified 12 biomarkers consistently associated with either clinical groups "upstream" towards culture-positive TB on the TB disease spectrum (CD14, FCGR1A, FPR1, MMP9, RAB24, SEC14L1, and TIMP2) or "downstream" towards a decreased likelihood of TB disease (BLR1, CD3E, CD8A, IL7R, and TGFBR2), suggesting a correlation with MTB-related pathology and high relevance to a future POC test for pediatric TB.
MCM6	retinoblastoma	Western blot assay further confirmed that anti-ICAM-T0901317 liposomes inhibited retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation and MCM6 expression.
MCM6	retinoblastoma	Inhibition of MCM6 and MCM7 expression by nTZDpa and rosiglitazone paralleled their effect to inhibit phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and cell proliferation.
Snord3A	scrapie	Snord3A expression was also elevated in scrapie infected mice, but not in PrP(0/0) mice, indicating that while the expression levels of this transcript may reflect diverse prion etiologies, they are not related to the loss of PrP(C)'s function.
Snord3A	prion disease	We hypothesize that in addition to its function as a disease marker, Snord3A may play an important role in the mechanism of prion disease manifestation and progression.
TACI	diabetes	Her son has type 1 diabetes, arthritis, reduced IgG levels and IgA deficiency, but has not inherited the TNFRSF13B/TACI mutation.
TACI	diabetes	Our results support the hypothesis that increased TACI expression on NOD B cells contributes to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes in the NOD mouse.
TACI	diabetes	A family member with a wild type TACI variant had CVID-related phenotype including IgA deficiency and type 1 diabetes.
TACI	diabetes	We mapped the loci contributing to the increased proportion of TACI(high) expressing splenic B cells and found that the control of TACI expression was strongly linked to chromosome 1, in a region which includes the insulin-dependent diabetes (Idd) 5 loci.
TACI	diabetes	Our findings corroborate the notion that B cell deviations contribute to type 1 diabetes development, and suggest a temporal regulation of TACI(high) expression, possibly influenced by the ongoing autoimmune process.
transcription factor 4	pancreatic cancer	Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) was closely related to pancreatic cancer progression, but its regulation in pancreatic cancer by microRNA (miRNA) is not fully clear.
transcription factor 4	pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma	This study was designed to investigate the expression of the T-box transcription factor 4 (TBX4), a tumor biomarker that was previously identified by proteomics, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and evaluate its clinical utility as a potential prognostic biomarkers for PDAC.
BLT	cancer	Whereas the pathological functions of LTB4/BLT1 axis in allergy, autoimmunity and cardiovascular disorders are well established; its role in cancer is only beginning to emerge.
BLT	glioma	Bioluminescence tomography (BLT) is a powerful non-invasive molecular imaging tool for in vivo studies of glioma in mice.
BLT	glioma	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that achieved such accurate BLT morphological reconstruction of orthotopic glioma without using any segmented tumor structure from any other structural imaging modalities as the prior for reconstruction guidance.
BLT	glioma	This enabled BLT more suitable and practical for in vivo imaging of orthotopic glioma mouse models.
BLT	Cancer	The major objective of this study is to address this gap in our understanding of how IDO1 expression contributes to the biology of GBM, and whether its level of expression is a determinant of GBM patient outcome.Experimental Design: Patient-resected GBM, The Cancer Genome Atlas, human T-cell:GBM cocultures, as well as nu/nu, NOD-scid, and humanized (NSG-SGM3-BLT) mice-engrafted human GBM form the basis of our investigation.Results:In situ hybridization for IDO1 revealed transcript expression throughout patient-resected GBM, whereas immunohistochemical IDO1 positivity was highly variable.
BLT	cancer	Together with CT, BLT can provide precision radiation guidance and robust tumor volume assessment in small animal cancer research.
BLT	cancer	Variation of detected bioluminescence signals emitted from molecular cancer cells was depicted on BLT images.
BLT	cancer	Multispectral BLT images elaborated on early detection of cancer cells, characteristics of tumor growth, and metastasis for more accurate determination of internal bioluminescent sources.
BLT	cancer	Registration of BLT with CT images guided molecular cancer cells on anatomical coordinates.
BLT	cancer	The BLT imaging was a useful tool to localize cancer cells and to quantify radiation response.
BLT	cancer	Application of BLT led to more accurate definition of tumor volumes including molecular probe-based microscopic cancer cells.
BLT	cancer	Thus, in this report, we not only provide a novel strategy to expand super-charged NK cells, but also demonstrate that rapid and sustained expansion of residual T cells within the purified NK cells during expansion with DCs or OCs could be a potential mechanism by which the numbers and function of NK cells decline in cancer patients and in BLT-humanized mice.
BLT	squamous cell carcinoma	Verrucous carcinoma (VC) is a variant of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and in the anal region is regarded as synonymous with giant condyloma (Buschke-Loewenstein tumour) (BLT).
Fgf8	Crouzon syndrome	To test this idea, we infected migrating neural crest cells of chicken embryos with  replication-competent avian sarcoma virus expressing either FgfR2(C278F), a receptor mutation found in Crouzon syndrome or the ligand Fgf8.
fgf8	craniosynostosis	These defects are similar in presentation to several human craniofacial disorders (e.g., craniosynostosis, hemifacial microsomia), and may be related to increased levels of bone metabolism observed in ace(ti282a)/fgf8 heterozygotes.
FGF8	craniosynostosis	Since FGF8 maps to the same chromosomal region as FGFR2, has indeed been shown to be a ligand for FGFR2, and has an expression pattern consistent with limb and craniofacial anomalies, we have screened two kindreds with Pfeiffer syndrome that were previously linked to markers from 10q24-25 and a large number of individuals with craniosynostosis and limb anomalies for mutations in the coding sequence of FGF8.
Trx-1	cerebral infarct	The results demonstrated that rhTrx-1 significantly improved neurological functions and reduced cerebral infarction and apoptotic cell death at 24h after MCAO.
Trx1	cerebral infarct	Treatment with Trx1 siRNA significantly increased mortality, behavioral deficits, and cerebral infarction volume and exacerbated neuronal cell apoptotic death after MCAO injury.
Trx-1	cerebral infarct	The results showed that intravenously administered rhTrx-1 (10 mg/kg) significantly improved neurological functions and reduced cerebral infarction and apoptotic cell death following cerebral ischemia.
Trx-1	cerebral infarct	Furthermore, the suppression on ONOO- formation by either rhTrx-1 or an ONOO- scavenger uric acid reduced cerebral infarct size in mice subjected to cerebral ischemia.
Proenkephalin	renal failure	Proenkephalin (pro-ENK), a stable and reliable surrogate marker for unstable enkephalins, was found to be associated with acute kidney injury and chronic renal failure in previous studies.
PENK	CKD	PENK and NGAL concentrations were measured and GFR was estimated by using the isotope dilution mass spectrometry traceable-Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study and three Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations: CKD-EPI(Cr), CDK-EPI(CysC), and CKD-EPI(Cr-CysC).
Proenkephalin	CRF	Proenkephalin cleavage products stored within cells, which included the 5.3-kDa peptide, could be released upon stimulation of cells with BaCl2 (2-fold above basal levels), 8-bromo-cAMP or CRF (7- and 8-fold above basal levels, respectively), and a mixture of BaCl2 and 8-bromo-cAMP (20-fold above basal levels).

epidermal growth factor	cerebellar ataxia	Lastly, a recent study identified delta/notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor (DNER) as the target antigen of Tr antibodies, a marker of cerebellar ataxia and Hodgkin's lymphoma.
CHSY1	CLE	Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed significantly increased expression of HAS2, CHSY1, and C4ST1 in the combined groups of CLE lesions (n = 8) compared to healthy controls (n = 4).
CHSY1	CLE	Thus, the increase in HA in CLE presumably results from upregulation of HAS2, whereas CHSY1 and C4ST1 appear to contribute to increased CS.
MC-FP	diabetes	Through Part 4 of Maintenance of Certification for Family Physicians (MC-FP), American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM) diplomates participate in quality improvement (QI) modules for diabetes.
MC-FP	diabetes	Family physicians participating in MC-FP implemented improvement projects and showed quality improvements in caring for patients with diabetes.
TNF-beta	Graves' disease	Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and Graves' disease (GD) are autoimmune endocrinopathies and associated with distinct HLA-DR and -DQ alleles as well as several tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and beta (TNF-beta) alleles.
TNFB	Graves' disease	Studies in Caucasians have suggested that the TNFB gene might be a susceptibility gene for Graves' disease.
TNFB	Graves' disease	To investigate further the role of TNFB in predisposition to Graves' disease, we determined whether the TNFB disease associations in the Chinese were similar to those in Caucasians.
TNFB	Graves' disease	We conclude that the TNFB associations with Graves' disease in the Hong Kong Chinese differ between the genders and from those described in Caucasians.
TNFB	Graves' disease	The TNFB gene is not a susceptibility gene for Graves' disease.
TNF beta	Graves' disease	We show here a significant association of TNF beta polymorphisms with Graves' disease.
TNF beta	Graves' disease	Although TNF beta polymorphisms are linked to A1B8DR3, these results suggest that they represent an additional susceptibility marker in Graves' disease.
Cul1	medulloblastoma	Here, we summarize our findings of targeted SOX9 destruction by SCFFBW7 (Skp1/Cul1/F-box) in medulloblastoma and its potential for therapeutic intervention.

RAH	pericarditis	Epicardial LGEs were identified in 10/13 and pericarditis in 6/13 RAH.
RAH	pericarditis	An RA relapse was observed after 7-40 days in 10/13 RAH with myopericarditis.
ADAM23	glioma	We found that LGI3 and its receptors, ADAM22 and ADAM23, were significantly downregulated in glioma tissues.
ADAM23	glioma	Analysis of expression microarray data of glioma cohorts demonstrated that low expression levels of LGI3, ADAM22 and ADAM23 were significantly associated with poor prognosis of glioma.
ADAM23	Glioma	Rather, we observed that, in ADAM23-heterotypic environments, ADAM23-negative cells promote tumor growth and metastasis by enhancing the proliferation and invasion of adjacent A23-positive cells through the production of LGI4 (Leucine-rich Glioma Inactivated 4) and nitric oxide (NO).
ADAM28	carcinoma	The aim of the present study was to evaluate ADAM28 and Insulin Like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3 (IGFBP-3)) gene expression in colorectal carcinoma tissues with regard to the overweight or obese status of the patients using an oligonucleotide microarray technique.
CD271	uveal melanoma	The expression of cancer stem cell marker cluster of differentiation 271 (CD271) was determined in traditional two-dimensional (2D) and 3D cultures of C918 uveal melanoma cells by fluorescent immunocytochemistry.
TGFBI	GCD	The missense mutation (c.370G &gt; A) in the TGFBI gene and insert mutation (c.1456-1457ins GAT) in the KRT12 gene were identified in a 23-year-old male patient with concurrent KC and GCD.
TGFBI	granular corneal dystrophy	This study investigated the TGFBI gene mutation types in outpatients clinically diagnosed with granular corneal dystrophy (GCD) prior to phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK), also calculated the mutation rate of subjects with normal corneas, but positive family history.
TGFBI	granular corneal dystrophy	To describe 2 unrelated families with multiple members demonstrating a less commonly recognized vortex pattern of corneal deposits confirmed to be granular corneal dystrophy type 1 (GCD1) after identification of the p.(Arg555Trp) mutation in the transforming growth factor Beta-induced gene (TGFBI).
TGFBI	GCD	Screening of TGFBI in both families revealed a heterozygous missense mutation [p.(Arg555Trp)] in exon 12, confirming the diagnosis of GCD1.
TGFBI	GCD	Although this pattern of dystrophic deposits is not recognized by clinicians as a typical phenotype of GCD1, it is consistent with the production of the majority of the TGFBI protein by the corneal epithelium.
LCD1	granular corneal dystrophy	In this study, patients with macular corneal dystrophy (MCD; n = 18), granular corneal dystrophy type 1 (GCD1; n = 12), and lattice corneal dystrophy type 1 (LCD1; n = 4), as well as 50 healthy controls, were subjected to clinical and genetic examinations.
TGFBI	GCD	Variations were analyzed with DNA sequencing in the coding region of CHST6 in patients with MCD and exons 4 and 12 in TGFBI in patients with LCD1 and GCD1.
TGFBI	GCD	The previously reported R555W mutation in TGFBI was detected in 12 patients with GCD1, and the R124C mutation in TGFBI was detected in four patients with LCD1.
TGFBI	GCD	We detected previously reported, well-known hot spot mutations in TGFBI in the patients with GCD1 and LCD1.
TGFBI	granular corneal dystrophy	TGFBeta1-induced expression of transforming growth factor Beta-induced protein (TGFBIp) and extracellular matrix (ECM) genes plays a major role in the development of granular corneal dystrophy type 2 (GCD2: also called Avellino corneal dystrophy).
TGFBI	GCD	We examined the role of chromatin markers such as histone H3 lysine methylation (H3Kme) in TGFBeta1-induced TGFBIp and ECM gene expression in normal and GCD2-derived human corneal fibroblasts.
TGFBI	GCD	Transcription and extracellular-secretion levels of TGFBIp were high in normal cells compared with those in GCD2-derived cells and were related to H3K4me3 levels but not to DNA methylation over the TGFBI locus.
TGFBI	granular corneal dystrophy	This study expands on our previous research investigating dystrophic stromal aggregates, with the aim of better elucidating the pathomechanism of two conditions arising from the most common TGFBI mutations: granular corneal dystrophy type 1 (GCD1; R555W) and lattice corneal dystrophy type 1 (LCD1; R124C).
LCD1	GCD	Patient corneas with GCD1 and LCD1 were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Congo red to visualize stromal nonamyloid and amyloid deposits, respectively.
LCD1	GCD	An increase in the number of residues experiencing cleavage was observed in both GCD1 aggregates and LCD1 deposits.
LCD1	GCD	The study reveals previously unknown differences between the protein composition of GCD1 and LCD1 aggregates, and confirms the presence of the HtrA1 protease in LCD1-amyloid aggregates.
TGFBI	GCD	GCD is a Category 1, Stromal, TGFBI-associated corneal dystrophy.
TGFBI	granular corneal dystrophy	We show here that the Arg555Trp mutant of the fourth fasciclin 1 (FAS1-4) domain of the protein (TGFBIp/keratoepithelin/Betaig-h3), associated with granular corneal dystrophy type 1, is significantly less susceptible to proteolysis by thermolysin and trypsin than the WT domain.
MiR-139-5p	bladder cancer	MiR-139-5p has been reported to be overexpressed in many types of cancers, but its role in bladder cancer has not been elucidated yet.
miR-139	bladder cancer	Here, we report that miR-139-5p functions as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer and inhibits the cancer stem cell self-renewal by targeting Bmi1 directly.
miR-139	bladder cancer	We found that miR-139-5p expression was significantly downregulated in the bladder cancer specimens compared with that in adjacent normal tissues.
miR-139	bladder cancer	In vitro, restoration of miR-139-5p expression significantly inhibited the proliferation of bladder cancer cells.
miR-139	bladder cancer	Stem cell-related proteins such as c-MYC, NANOG, OCT4, and KLF4 and signaling pathways such as Wnt signaling were suppressed by restoration of miR-139-5p in bladder cancer cells.
miR-139	bladder cancer	In addition, miR-139-5p expression also blocked self-renewal of bladder cancer stem cells by inhibiting Bmi1.
miR-139	bladder cancer	In summary, our study supports that miR-139-5p acts as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer development and suppresses cancer stem cell property of bladder cancer.
miR-139	bladder cancer	Our study also suggests that miR-139-5p has the potential to be used as a therapeutic molecule for bladder cancer treatment.
CblC	hypertension	We present a case with CblC disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) as the main symptom.
CblC	hypertension	CblC disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension.
OPRD1	Alzheimer's disease	Genetic association of rs678849 along with neuroimaging and biomarker phenotypes, parallel with the known involvements of the OPRD1 in drug abuse, provided additional support for targeting these receptors as potential therapeutic targets in both neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiactric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
HNK-1ST	melanoma	Recently, a robust up-regulation of human natural killer-1 sulfotransferase (HNK-1ST) was found in several subsets of melanoma cells during RA-mediated differentiation.
HNK-1ST	melanoma	Here, we show that HNK-1ST changed the glycosylation state and reduced the ligand binding activity of Alfa-dystroglycan (Alfa-DG) in RA-treated S91 melanoma cells, which contributed to an attenuation of cell migration.
CHST10	schizophrenia	Ten genes of importance for HNK-1 biosynthesis (B3GAT1, B3GAT2, and CHST10) or for the formation of perineuronal nets (TNR, BCAN, NCAN, HAPLN1, HAPLN2, HAPLN3, and HAPLN4) were investigated for potential involvement in schizophrenia (SCZ) susceptibility, by genotyping 104 tagSNPs in the Scandinavian Collaboration on Psychiatric Etiology sample (849 cases; 1602 control subjects).
CHST10	melanoma	We show that CHST10 is also regulated by RARgamma in a significant subset of human melanoma cells, and three-dimensional cell culture migration assays suggest that CHST10 functions as a suppressor of invasiveness, but not proliferation, in these cells.
CHST10	melanoma	Induction of CHST10 by RARgamma-activating retinoids may present a novel therapeutic strategy to inhibit invasiveness in a subset of melanoma patients.
HNK1ST	disease	No disease-associated mutations were detected in the candidate genes SEMA4C, CNGA3 or HNK1ST from within the region.
XLMTM	respiratory failure	Most XLMTM patients develop severe muscle weakness leading to respiratory failure and death, typically within 2 years of age.
MTM1	respiratory failure	Mutations in the MTM1 gene cause X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), characterized by neonatal hypotonia and respiratory failure, and are responsible for a premature mortality in affected males.
XLMTM	respiratory failure	X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital neuromuscular disorder defined by severe hypotonia, respiratory failure and histopathologic changes in muscle biopsy.
CNM	respiratory failure	Centronuclear (myotubular) myopathy (CNM) is congenital and produces various degrees of muscular weakness and associated complications such as respiratory failure.
XLMTM	respiratory failure	Patients with XLMTM often have severe perinatal weakness that requires mechanical ventilation to prevent death from respiratory failure.

FGFR2	acanthosis nigricans	This study reveals the pleiotropic effects of the FGFR2 Y394C mutation evidenced by cutis gyrata, acanthosis nigricans, and craniosynostosis and provides a useful model for investigating the molecular mechanisms of skin and skull development.
FGFR2	acanthosis nigricans	Some cases of congenital skeletal disorders with an FGFR2 mutation show skin phenotypes, including acne, cutis gyrata, and acanthosis nigricans.
neuronal nuclei	trigeminal neuralgia	Peripheral nerve and spinal cord injuries, along with other painful syndromes such as fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapeutic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, and/or irritable bowel syndrome, cause several neuroplasticity changes in the nervous system along its entire axis affecting the different neuronal nuclei.
SORLA	Alzheimer's disease	Sortilin-related receptor with LDLR class A repeats (SORLA, SORL1, or LR11) is a genetic risk factor associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
sortilin-related receptor	Alzheimer's disease	A meta-analysis was performed to identify empirical data assessing the effects of a single nucleotide polymorphisms of sortilin-related receptor on Alzheimer's disease based on 14 studies involving 37941 cases and 49727 control studies.
SORL1	Alzheimer's disease	Given these data, we provide crucial evidence to manifest that a significant relationship exists between SORL1 polymorphisms and the susceptibility of Alzheimer's disease.
SORL1	Dementia	Furthermore, a third SORL1 variant, c.5195G &gt; C, recently identified in a Swedish case control cohort included in the European Early-Onset Dementia (EU EOD) consortium study, was detected in two affected siblings in a third family with familial EOAD.
CD47	pulmonary hypertension	Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a ligand for CD47 and TSP1-/- mice are protected from pulmonary hypertension (PH).
CD47	pulmonary hypertension	We further discuss therapeutic strategies for enhancing or inhibiting CD47 signaling and applications of such agents in preclinical models of ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion injuries, organ transplantation, pulmonary hypertension, radioprotection, and cancer.
my g	cancer	In present study, anticancer activity of ethanol extract of Chinese propolis (EECP) at 25, 50, 100, and 200  my g/mL was explored by testing the cytotoxicity in MCF-7 (human breast cancer ER(+)) and MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer ER(-)) cells.
my g	cancer	We exposed human pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa-2 (CRL-1420) to 34  my g/mL of LE for 24, 48, and 72 hours.
JAG1	adrenocortical carcinoma	In addition, variations in JAG1 have been found to be associated with multiple types of cancer including breast cancer and adrenocortical carcinoma.
Jagged-1	pancreatic cancer	The role of the extract in pancreatic cancer treatment was associated with down-regulation of Notch-4 and Jagged-1 in Notch signaling pathway.
situs inversus totalis	sigmoid colon cancer	The patient was a 64-year-old man with situs inversus totalis who had previously undergone sigmoidectomy with regional lymphadenectomy for sigmoid colon cancer at age 62.
situs inversus totalis	sigmoid colon cancer	For the treatment of hepatic metastases from sigmoid colon cancer in a patient with situs inversus totalis, "left" hepatic lobectomy, partial hepatectomy, and radiofrequency ablation therapy were performed.
IL-4	pulmonary eosinophilia	On day 25, pulmonary eosinophilia, airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus hypersecretion, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, -5 and -13 in BAL fluid, gene expression of inflammatory mediators such as 5-LOX, E-selectin, VCAM-1, CCL5, TNF-Alfa, AMCase, Ym2, YKL-40, Muc5ac, CCL2 and iNOS in animal lung tissues, and serum IgE were determined.
IL-4	pulmonary eosinophilia	Our results show that tropical pulmonary eosinophilia mice exhibited increased levels of IL-4, IL-5, CCL5, and CCL11 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung parenchyma along with elevated titers of IgE and IgG subtypes in the serum.
IL-4	pulmonary eosinophilia	A(2B) R deficiency resulted in a dramatic reduction on Th2-type airways responses with decreased pulmonary eosinophilia without augmenting neutrophilia, and decreased lung IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 production.
IL-4	pulmonary eosinophilia	Both isoforms caused pulmonary infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils, whereas mm IL-33 also caused pulmonary eosinophilia and goblet cell hyperplasia and increased expression of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17, MCP-1, and KC.
IL-4	pulmonary eosinophilia	Germline deficiency of the cell surface receptor chain ST2 abrogated the mm IL-33-induced Th2-associated effects (pulmonary eosinophilia, goblet cell hyperplasia, and increased IL-4 and IL-5), yet the lymphocytic infiltration induced by full-length mouse IL-33 or mm IL-33 was not fully abrogated by the absence of ST2.
IL-4	pulmonary eosinophilia	OVA-challenged STAT6-/- mice had neither AHR nor pulmonary eosinophilia, but had increased expression of mRNA for TNF-Alfa, IFN-Gamma and IL-4.
GLP-2R	diabetes	GLP-1R agonists are used to treat diabetes and obesity, and a GLP-2R agonist is approved to treat short bowel syndrome.
GLP-2R	type 2 diabetes mellitus	RNA-seq analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed to evaluate the presence of GLP-1R and GLP-2R in EAT and subcutaneous fat (SAT) obtained from 8 subjects with coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing elective cardiac surgery.
GLP2R	diabetes	Gastric tissue samples of non-obese patients (NOB, n=10) and obese patients without diabetes (OB, n=31) and with diabetes (OWD, n=12) were used to evaluate GLP2R expression and distribution.
GLP2R	diabetes	This is the first evidence of increased GLP2R expression in chief cells of patients with severe obesity regardless of diabetes status.
GLP-2R	diabetes	We examined the importance of GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) signaling for glucose homeostasis in multiple models of metabolic stress, diabetes, and obesity.
Glp2r	diabetes	Moreover, glucose homeostasis was comparable in Glp2r(-/-) and Glp2r(+/+) mice fed a high-fat diet for 5 months or after induction of streptozotocin-induced diabetes.
erythropoietin	ureteral obstruction	In a model of tubulointerstitial fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction in mice, increased collagen I protein content and an almost complete disappearance of erythropoietin mRNA expression were observed in the ureteral ligated kidney with respect to the contralateral control.
EPO	ureteral obstruction	In the present study, employing a mouse model of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), we demonstrated that EPO markedly reduced the disruption of the tubular basement membrane (TBM) through attenuating the activation of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), the major matrix proteolytic network in the obstructed kidney.
EPO	ureteral obstruction	The MVs derived from untreated MSCs (MSC-MVs) or from MSCs incubated in different concentrations of EPO (1, 10, 100, and 500 IU/ml EPO-MVs) were used to treat renal injury of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in vivo, and transforming growth factor-Beta1 (TGF-Beta1)-induced fibrosis in a human renal proximal tubular epithelial (HK2) cell line in vitro.
EPO	ureteral obstruction	Twenty-four male C57BL6 mice were randomly divided into four groups, each comprising six mice: (i) control group (Sh); (ii) unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) plus vehicle group (U+V); (#ⅲ) UUO plus 300 U/kg body weight recombinant human (rh)EPO (U+E1) and (#ⅳ) UUO plus 1,000 U/kg body weight rhEPO (U+E2).
Epo	ureteral obstruction	The aim of this study is to show and compare the actions of Simvastatin (Simv) and Erythropoietin (Epo) in renal expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NFKB), transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-Beta), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B), fibronectin and development of interstitial fibrosis in rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO).
Epo	ureteral obstruction	In a novel mouse model, unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced inflammatory milieu activated NFKB and Smad signaling pathways in REPs, rapidly repressed the Epo-producing potential of REPs, and led to myofibroblast transformation of these cells.
Epo	ureteral obstruction	Reversing the unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced inflammatory microenvironment restored the Epo-producing potential and the physiologic phenotype of REPs.
EPO	hydronephrosis	Secondary polycythemia with increased production of erythropoietin (EPO) is known to occur in kidney diseases such as hydronephrosis and cystic disease, but the mechanism remains unclear.
arginase 1	priapism	Decompartmentalized hemoglobin, arginase 1, asymmetric dimethylarginine, and adenine nucleotides are all products of hemolysis that promote vasomotor dysfunction, proliferative vasculopathy, and a multitude of clinical complications of pulmonary and systemic vasculopathy, including pulmonary hypertension, leg ulcers, priapism, chronic kidney disease, and large-artery ischemic stroke.

stabilin-2	KCs	Freshly isolated LSECs, Kupffer cells (KCs), and stabilin-1- and stabilin-2-transfected human embryonic kidney cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled or radiolabeled oxLDLs [oxidized for 3 h (oxLDL(3)), 6 h, or 24 h (oxLDL(24))] to measure endocytosis.
Ptprz	gastritis	Furthermore, pleiotrophin (PTN), an endogenous ligand of Ptprz, also induced gastritis specifically in Ptprz+/+ mice when administered orally.
Krebs von den Lungen-6	MCTD	We aimed to determine whether serum levels of Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) and surfactant protein-D (SP-D) correlate with SSc/MCTD-associated ILD activity.
KL-6	MCTD	Serum KL-6 correlated positively with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (% predicted) and disease extent on HRCT, and the changes in serum levels of KL-6 were significantly related to the changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) in SSc/MCTD-associated ILD.
KL-6	MCTD	Our study suggests that serum KL-6 can be a useful monitoring tool of SSc/MCTD-associated ILD activity.
KL-6	mixed connective tissue disease	The KL-6 levels did not differ significantly according to the connective tissue diseases in the diagnostic groups (systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjoegren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective tissue disease, scleroderma, polymyositis/ dermatomyositis).
MUC1	Sjogren's syndrome	To quantify and compare human mucin 1 (MUC1) protein and mRNA expression in tears and conjunctival epithelial cells collected from Sjogren's syndrome (SS), non-Sjogren's keratoconjunctivitus sicca (KCS) and non-dry eyed (NDE) control subjects.
idiopathic short stature	achondroplasia	We studied 21 patients referred for idiopathic short stature, 5 with clinically suspected hypochondroplasia and 4 with achondroplasia.
idiopathic short stature	achondroplasia	A series of 140 patients with short stature operated on for limb lengthening (80 had achondroplasia, 20 had hypochondroplasia, 20 had Turner syndrome, 10 had idiopathic short stature due to an undemonstrated cause, 5 regarded their stature as too short, and 5 had a psychopathic personality due to dysmorphophobia that had developed because of their short stature) was reviewed.

IRS-1	uveal melanoma	miR-145 might act as a tumor suppressor in uveal melanoma, and downregulation of the target IRS-1 might be a potential mechanism.
IRS-1	medulloblastoma	Almost a decade ago, we reported the presence of nuclear IRS-1 in medulloblastoma clinical samples, which express viral oncoprotein, large T-antigen of human polyomavirus JC (JCV T-antigen).
IRS-1	medulloblastoma	More recently, nuclear IRS-1 was detected in breast cancer cells in association with estrogen receptor alpha (ERAlfa), and in JC virus negative medulloblastoma cells expressing estrogen receptor beta (ERBeta), further implicating nuclear IRS-1 in cellular transformation.
insulin receptor substrate 1	medulloblastoma	We have previously reported that ERBeta, which is highly expressed in medulloblastomas, translocates insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) to the nucleus, and that nuclear IRS-1 binds to Rad51 and attenuates homologous recombination directed DNA repair (HRR).
JBS	JBS	Jacobsen syndrome (JBS) is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving terminal chromosome 11q.
JBS	JBS	We investigated a boy with features of JBS using classic cytogenetic methods, FISH and high-resolution array CGH.
JBS	JBS	The patient had a hemizygous deletion in the FLI1 gene region without apparent thrombocytopenia, and he developed diabetes mellitus type I, which has not previously been described in the spectrum of disorders associated with JBS.
JBS	JBS	The relationship of some of the genes within the context of the phenotype caused by a partial deletion of 11q has provided insights concerning the developmental anomalies presented in this patient with atypical features of JBS.
JBS	JBS	All local patients were clustered "high-risk" for future CV events based on the Framingham score (mean 21.8%, 95% CI 20.0-23.6), JBS-2 (16.3%, 14.7-17.9) and ASSIGN (25.2%, 22.7-27.7).
UBR1	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome	Loss-of-function mutations in the UBR1 gene cause Johanson-Blizzard syndrome, which involves pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.
UBR1	pancreatitis	No previous studies have examined an association of UBR1 variants with pancreatitis, in part due to the large size of the gene.
UBR1	pancreatitis	This study aimed to clarify whether UBR1 variants are associated with chronic pancreatitis (CP) by the application of targeted next generation sequencing.
JBS	JBS	Jacobsen syndrome (JBS) is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving 11q terminal deletion.
JBS	JBS	Interstitial deletions at distal 11q are rare and their contributions to the clinical phenotype of JBS are unknown.
JBS	JBS	Our finds support the notion that more than one critical region at 11q23.3-qter are responsible for the variable clinical presentation of JBS, thus JBS is a true contiguous gene deletion syndrome where multiple loci contributed to the clinical characteristics of JBS.
JBS	JBS	Jacobsen syndrome (JBS) is an uncommon contiguous gene syndrome.
JBS	intellectual disability	The typical clinical features in JBS include intellectual disability, growth retardation, craniofacial dysmorphism as well as craniosynostosis, congenital heart disease, and platelet abnormalities.
JBS	JBS	We report a novel deletion in JBS that increases the knowledge of the variability in the mutation sites in this region and expands the spectrum of molecular and clinical defects in this syndrome.
JBS	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS) is considered as an infrequent, but clinically easily recognizable autosomal recessive entity by the pathognomonic combination of congenital exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and hypoplastic alae nasi, in addition to other distinctive findings such as scalp defects, hypothyroidism, and rectourogenital malformations.
JBS	JBS	There are few reports of patients with JBS in association with facial clefting, referring all to types 2 to 6 of Tessier's classification that can be characterized properly as oblique facial clefts (OFCs).
JBS	JBS	We describe the clinical aspects in four patients with JBS and extensive OFCs.
UBR1	JBS	In all of them, the diagnosis of JBS was confirmed by the demonstration of homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in the UBR1 gene.
JBS	JBS	Additionally, we review three previously reported cases of JBS with OFCs.
JBS	JBS	Taking into account a number of approximately 100 individuals affected by JBS that have been published in the literature we estimate that the frequency of OFCs in JBS is between 5% and 10%.
JBS	JBS	This report emphasizes that extensive OFCs may be the severe end of the spectrum of facial malformations occurring in JBS.
JBS	JBS	Jacobsen syndrome (JBS) is a rare congenital disorder caused by a terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11.
JBS	JBS	PX-RICS is located in the chromosomal region commonly deleted in JBS patients with autistic-like behaviour.

JBS	Joubert syndrome	Joubert syndrome (JBS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder belonging to the group of ciliary diseases.
JBS	JBS	JBS is genetically heterogeneous, with &gt;20 causative genes identified to date.
JBS	JBS	A molecular diagnosis of JBS is essential for prediction of disease progression and genetic counseling.
JBS	JBS	We developed a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach for parallel sequencing of 22 known JBS genes plus 599 additional ciliary genes.
JBS	JBS	This method was used to genotype a cohort of 51 well-phenotyped Northern European JBS cases (in some of the cases, Sanger sequencing of individual JBS genes had been performed previously).
JBS	JBS	Altogether, 21 of the 51 cases (41%) harbored biallelic pathogenic mutations in known JBS genes, including 14 mutations not previously described.
JBS	JBS	Our study represents a population-based cohort of JBS patients not enriched for consanguinity, providing insight into the relative importance of the different JBS genes in a Northern European population.
JBS	Meckel-Gruber syndrome	Furthermore, we report a case with heterozygous mutations in CC2D2A and B9D1, a gene associated with the more severe Meckel-Gruber syndrome that was recently published as a potential new JBS gene, and discuss the significance of this finding.
OVOL1	nasopharyngeal carcinoma	ZIC2 and OVOL1 may function in nasopharyngeal carcinoma through targeting significantly up-regulated genes (such as PTGS2, FN1, CXCL9 and CXCL10) in the Transcription factor-differentially expressed gene regulatory network (e.g., ZIC2-&gt;PTGS2 and OVOL1-&gt;CXCL10).
OVOL1	nasopharyngeal carcinoma	PTGS2, FN1, CXCL9, CXCL10, ZIC2 and OVOL1 might play roles in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

PRL	Behcet's disease	Furthermore in the last 2 decades multi-organ and organ specific autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjogren's syndrome (SS), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, hepatitis C patients, Behcet's disease, peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) and active celiac disease were discussed to be associated with HPRL.
prolactin	Sjogren's syndrome	Hyperprolactinemia (HPRL) is observed in multi-organ and organ specific autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjogren's syndrome (SS), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and multiple sclerosis (MS).
PRL	polymyalgia rheumatica	We describe the role of PRL in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases, particularly connective tissue diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), primary Sjoegren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and seronegative arthritis.
TLR9	eosinophilia	Moreover, we show that the reduction of eosinophilia and the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the lungs required early triggering of TLR9, IFN-Gamma and CCR2 by immunotherapy components.
TLR9	lymphopenia	Subjects treated with TLR9 agonists were at a higher risk of anemia (risk ratio [RR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.06), neutropenia (RR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.11-1.21), leukopenia (RR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.11-1.22), lymphopenia (RR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.10-1.25), thrombocytopenia (RR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.14-1.27), flu-like symptoms (RR 10.59, 95% CI: 3.66-30.66), diarrhea (RR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.18-1.67) and headache (RR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.26-2.06).
TLR9	eosinophilia	Both the TLR7 and TLR9 agonists dose dependently reduced airway eosinophilia, while the TLR3 agonist only reduced airway eosinophilia at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg.
LPP	lichen planus	&lt;p&gt;Lichen planopilaris (LPP) is a variant of lichen planus that affects the scalp causing scarring hair loss.
LPP	atrophoderma	This family of diseases contains 2 subgroups, largely based on clinical features: keratosis pilaris atrophicans (KPA; including keratosis pilaris atrophicans faciei/ulerythema ophryogenes, atrophoderma vermiculata, and keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans); and the lichen planopilaris (LPP) subgroup (including LPP, frontal fibrosing alopecia, Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lassueur Syndrome and fibrosing alopecia in a pattern distribution).
LPP	dermatitis	An interface dermatitis with lichenoid inflammation is characteristic of the LPP group of disorders, but the literature provides scant information about the histopathology of the KPA group.
LPP	lichen planus	Recently, there have been25 cases reported in the literature of lichen planuspigmentosus (LPPi) that preceded the developmentof frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA), which is a variantof lichen planopilaris (LPP).
LPP	psoriasis	Lower levels of acylCer and LPP accompany skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, lamellar ichthyosis, and psoriasis.

CD247	preeclampsia	However, genes like HSP90, PAK2, CD247 and others included in the first 1% of the prioritized list need to be further explored in preeclampsia pathogenesis through experimental approaches.
myoglobin	diabetic ketoacidosis	We report a case of acute pancreatitis with diabetic ketoacidosis associated with increased serum myoglobin concentration, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
myoglobin	diabetic ketoacidosis	We examined the relationship among acute pancreatitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, and hypermyoglobinemia in the literature.
myoglobin	diabetic ketoacidosis	The frequency of nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis in diabetic ketoacidosis was investigated by serial measurements of the serum levels of myoglobin and the serum activity of creatine kinase isoenzyme MM in 12 consecutively admitted ketoacidotic patients.
myoglobin	diabetic ketoacidosis	In conclusion, our findings suggest that nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis with hypermyoglobinaemia and elevated serum activity of creatine kinase isoenzyme MM may be a hitherto unrecognized common feature of diabetic ketoacidosis.
HMGN5	cancer	Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-495 targets the 3'-untranslated region of high-mobility group nucleosome-binding domain 5 (HMGN5), a potential oncogene in various types of cancers.
HMGN5	glioma	High-mobility group nucleosome-binding domain 5 (HMGN5), a well-known oncogene in gliomas, was identified as a functional target of miR-409-3p using bioinformatics, dual-luciferase reporter assay, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot analysis.
HMGN5	glioma	Restoration of HMGN5 expression significantly reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-409-3p overexpression on glioma cell invasion and proliferation.
HMGN5	glioma	Taken together, our results suggest that miR-409-3p inhibits glioma cell invasion and proliferation by targeting HMGN5, representing a potential therapeutic target for glioma.
HMGN5	cancer	It was first discovered in mouse, and recent studies found that the expressions of HMGN5 in many human cancers were also highly regulated, such as prostate, bladder, breast, and lung and clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
HMGN5	cancer	Importantly, deficiency of HMGN5 has been shown to be linked to cancer cell growth, cell cycle regulation, migration, invasion, and clinical outcomes, and it represents a promising therapeutic target for many malignant tumors.
HMGN5	cancer	In the present review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge concerning the role of HMGN5 in cancer development and progression.
NSBP1	cancer	Nucleosome-binding protein 1 (NSBP1) has been suggested as an oncogene in various types of human cancers.
NSBP1	cancer	We found that NSBP1 was highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and knockdown of NSBP1 by NSBP1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion.
NSBP1	NSCLC	Overexpression of miR-326 significantly inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion, which mimicked the effect of NSBP1 siRNA.
NSBP1	cancer	Furthermore, suppression of NSBP1 by NSBP1 siRNA or miR-326 overexpression remarkably repressed the expression of cyclin B1 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), which are associated with cancer cell proliferation and invasion.
NSBP1	NSCLC	In addition, an inverse correlation between miR-326 and NSBP1 expression levels was found in NSCLC clinical specimens.
NSBP1	NSCLC	Our study demonstrated a direct target relationship between NSBP1 and miR-326 through which miR-326 inhibited cell proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells.
NSBP1	cancer	Thus, miR-326-NSBP1 is a promising candidate target for developing novel anticancer therapeutics for NSCLC.
HMGN5	prostate cancer	Correlation analysis also showed that HMGN5 expression levels were significantly inversely correlated with the miR-340 expression in prostate cancer tissues.
HMGN5	prostate cancer	In addition, overexpression of HMGN5 significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-340 on prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasion.
HMGN5	prostate cancer	Moreover, the decreased miR-340 expression may contribute to the development and progression of prostate cancer through a mechanism that involves HMGN5.
HMGN5	prostate cancer	Thus, miR340 and its target gene HMGN5 can serve as potentially useful therapeutic candidates for prostate cancer treatment.
HMGN5	cancer	The high-mobility group nucleosome-binding protein-5 (HMGN5) is frequently overexpressed in various malignant cancers.
HMGN5	meningioma	However, the potential correlation between HMGN5 and prognosis in patients with meningiomas remains unknown.
HMGN5	meningioma	In the present study, we explored the expression of HMGN5 in meningiomas with immunohistochemistry and correlated the results to the patient outcome.
HMGN5	meningioma	We demonstrate that there is a positive association between HMGN5 expression and meningioma histological grade.
HMGN5	meningioma	Statistical analysis reveals that lower HMGN5 expression predict lower meningioma recurrence.
HMGN5	meningioma	Our results further revealed that HMGN5 inhibition decreased P-glycoprotein (MDR-1) expression without affecting multidrug resistance associated proteins 1 (MRP-1) expression to increase chemosensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) of meningioma cells.
HMGN5	meningioma	Collectively, this study indicates that HMGN5 is a novel target for developing effective therapeutic strategies for malignant meningiomas.
HMGN5	cancer	Luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-186 targets NSBP1 3'-untranslated region (UTR) directly and suppresses NSBP1 (HMGN5) expression in human bladder cancer cells.
NSBP1	cancer	Our data first time identified miR-186 as the upstream regulator of NSBP1 and also suggest miR-186-suppressed NSBP1 as a novel therapeutic approach for bladder cancer.
TK1	Burkitt's lymphoma	In this study, we show that TK1 is upregulated and localizes on the plasma membrane of Burkitt's lymphoma, acute promyelocytic leukemia, T cell leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
TK1	non-Hodgkin lymphoma	TK1 has been reported as a reliable prognostic factor in solid tumors and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but has not yet been tested in large populations of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
TK1	follicular lymphoma	In this study, the prognostic significance of TK1 levels was assessed in 170 prospectively enrolled patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL).
TK1	Follicular Lymphoma	The TK1 level at the time of treatment initiation was shown to correlate with the clinical stage, Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score, Beta(2)-microglobulin level, lactate dehydrogenase level and B symptoms.
TK1	B-cell lymphoma	We show that high serum TK1 levels predict poorer overall survival and correlate with unmutated immunoglobulin variable region genes, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, and subsequent risk of developing large B-cell lymphoma (Richter syndrome).
PODXL	colon cancer	In the present study, we revealed that the Hippo transducer, the transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), acts as a downstream mediator of PODXL in colon cancer.
PODXL	colon cancer	Moreover, PODXL plays a critical role in cancer stemness, invasiveness, and sensitivity to chemotherapies in colon cancer HCT15 cells.
PODXL	colon cancer	Notably, expression of PODXL showed a positive correlation with stem-like and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) core signatures, and was associated with poor survival outcomes in patients with colon cancer.
PODXL	colon cancer	These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of PODXL-mediated tumorigenesis in colon cancer.
PODXL	lung cancer	Podocalyxin (PODXL), which belongs to the CD34 family and regulates cell morphology, has been linked to EMT in lung cancer, and PODXL overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in several different classes of cancers.
PODXL	lung cancer	The aim of this study was to clarify the role of PODXL overexpression in EMT in lung cancer, and to determine the prognostic value of PODXL overexpression in tumors from lung cancer patients.
PODXL	lung adenocarcinoma	The morphology, EMT marker expression, and migration and invasion abilities of engineered A549 PODXL-knockdown (KD) or PODXL-overexpression (OE) lung adenocarcinoma cells were examined.
PODXL	lung adenocarcinoma	PODXL expression levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry in 114 human clinical lung adenocarcinoma specimens and correlated with clinical outcomes.
PODXL	lung adenocarcinoma	A highly selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling attenuated EMT of PODXL-OE cells, while a transforming growth factor inhibitor did not, suggesting that PODXL induces EMT of lung adenocarcinoma cells via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway.
PODXL	lung adenocarcinoma	In lung adenocarcinoma clinical specimens, PODXL expression was detected in minimally invasive and invasive adenocarcinoma, but not in non-invasive adenocarcinoma.
PODXL	lung adenocarcinoma	PODXL overexpression induces EMT in lung adenocarcinoma and contributes to tumor progression.
PODXL	gastric adenocarcinoma	The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of PODXL expression on survival in esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma.
PODXL	gastric adenocarcinoma	In gastric adenocarcinoma, patients with PODXL negative tumors had a superior TTR and a trend towards an improved OS.
PODXL	gastric adenocarcinoma	In esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma combined, the prognostic significance of PODXL expression on TTR was confirmed in unadjusted Cox regression analysis (HR = 5.36, 95 % CI 1.68-17.06, p = 0.005) and remained significant in the adjusted model (HR = 3.39, 95 % CI 1.01-11.35, p = 0.048).
PODXL	gastric adenocarcinoma	In esophageal and gastric adenocarcinoma, PODXL expression is an independent prognostic biomarker for reduced time to recurrence and poor overall survival.
PODXL	pancreatic cancer	Here, we report that high PODXL expression was an independent predictor of worse overall survival of pancreatic cancer patients, and that PODXL promoted pancreatic cancer cell motility and invasion by physically binding to the cytoskeletal protein gelsolin.
PODXL	pancreatic cancer	Furthermore, transfection of a PODXL-rescue construct into pancreatic cancer cells in which both PODXL and gelsolin were suppressed failed to increase the formation of the protrusions.
PODXL	colorectal cancer	Podocalyxin-like 1 (PODXL) is an anti-adhesive transmembrane protein that has been demonstrated to be an independent factor of poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC).
PODXL	pancreatic cancer	In addition, we identified a possible target of miR-5100, podocalyxin-like 1 (PODXL), and demonstrated miR-5100 directly binds to the 3' untranslated region of PODXL and post-transcriptionally regulates its expression in pancreatic cancer cells.
PODXL	pancreatic cancer	We also clarified the close relationship between expression of PODXL in human pancreatic cancer specimens and liver metastasis (P=0.0003), and determined that post-operative survival was longer in the low-PODXL expression group than in the high-PODXL expression group (P&lt;0.05).
PODXL	pancreatic cancer	These results indicate that miR-5100 and PODXL have considerable therapeutic potential for anti-metastatic therapy and could be potential indicators for cancer metastases in patients with pancreatic cancer.
podocalyxin	acute myeloid leukemia	Previously we demonstrated that miR-199b was significantly downregulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and targets podocalyxin and discoidin domain receptor 1.
podocalyxin	breast tumor	Therefore, we set out to determine if podocalyxin plays a functional role in breast tumor progression.
podocalyxin	breast tumor	Forced overexpression of podocalyxin caused cohesive clusters of epithelial MCF-7 breast tumor cells to bud off from the primary tumor and collectively invade the stroma of the mouse mammary gland in vivo.
DSTN	obesity	The DEGs MAPT, DSTN, SPTBN1, ARHGEF2 and SKA1 are suggested to be candidate biomarkers for childhood obesity.
DSN	Diabetes	All received support and advice by community Diabetes Specialist Nurses (DSNs) and Dieticians covering Central and Eastern Cheshire, UK.
DSN	Diabetes	In 2009, the PCT confirmed 3 years funding for a Paediatric Diabetes specialist nurse (PDSN) for schools.
DSN	diabetes	The aim of this study was to explore the interaction between diabetes specialist nurses (DSNs) and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) during group sessions about self-management.
DSN	diabetes	In 8 Italian municipalities, 2,512 men and women without both diabetes and CI-DSN at baseline are examined.
DSN	diabetes	The majority (72%) of PHCCs had diabetes-responsible general practitioners (GPs) and almost all (97%) had diabetes specialist nurses (DSNs) with some degree of postgraduate education in diabetes.
DSN	diabetes	The PHCCs reported that they used regional/local diabetes guidelines (93%), were engaged in call-recall diabetic reviews by GP(s) (66%) and DSN(s) (89%), checked that patients had participated in the reviews by GP(s) (69%) and DSN(s) (78%), arranged group education programmes (23%) and reported data to a National Diabetes Register (82%).
DSN	diabetes	The presence of diabetes-responsible GP(s) and DSN(s) who use guidelines may contribute to good and equal quality of care.
DSN	diabetes	To review the working practices of UK diabetes specialist nurses (DSNs), specific clinical roles, and to examine changes since 2000.
DSN	diabetes	Postal questionnaires were sent to lead DSNs from all identifiable UK diabetes centres (n = 361).
DSN	Diabetes	Quantitative and qualitative data were collected on the specific clinical roles, employment, and continual professional development of hospital and community DSNs, Nurse Consultants and Diabetes Healthcare Assistants.
DSN	diabetes	22% of DSNs have a formal role in diabetes research compared with 48% in 2000.
DSN	diabetes	Patients were recruited from 40 general practices and randomised (40:40:20 ratio) to receive routine care alone or, in addition, motivational telephone support from a peer supporter or a diabetes specialist nurse (9 peers and 12 DSNs) for a period of up to 6 months.
CL3	NSCLC	We exposed the human NSCLC cell lines Calu-1, CL3, H1299, CH27, H23, and H1355 to B[a]P and assessed cell cycle progression using flow cytometry.
CL3	non-small-cell lung carcinoma	Moreover, DOX-loaded micelles could slowly and efficiency decrease cell viability of non-small-cell lung carcinoma CL3 cells.
CL-3	lung adenocarcinoma	Comet assay was used to evaluate the DNA damage induced by a relatively low dose of COF (100 g/ml) in human lung adenocarcinoma CL-3 cells.
CL3	lung adenocarcinoma	Pb(II) increased the phosphorylated ERK1/2 and phosphorylated AKT but not the phosphorylated ERK5, phosphorylated p38 and JNK activity in human non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma CL3 cells.
CL-3	lung adenocarcinoma	The results from reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that the hOGG1 mRNA expression was induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and COF in human lung adenocarcinoma CL-3 cells.
CL-3	lung adenocarcinoma	To reveal the relationship between the high mortality rate of lung cancer in Chinese women and exposure to cooking oil fumes (COF), DNA adduct formation, induced by COF collected from frying fish under domestic conditions, was assessed in human lung adenocarcinoma CL-3 cell lines using the (32)P-postlabeling assay.
CL3	non-small cell lung carcinoma	In this study we have explored the involvement of oxidative stress in Cr(VI)-induced JNK, p38 and ERK signaling pathways and their effects on Cr(VI) cytotoxicity in human non-small cell lung carcinoma CL3 cells.
CL3	lung adenocarcinoma	The expression pattern of mucin genes was studied in 7 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (CL1, CL2, CL3, NCL2, PC9, PC13, PC14) and 12 lung adenocarcinoma tissues.
PHOSPHO1	Osteogenesis imperfecta	Osteogenesis imperfecta model, oim(-/-) , mice have a defect in the collagen, which leads to brittle bone; PHOSPHO1 mutants, Phospho1(-/-) , have ductile bone resulting from altered mineralization.
iPLA2	virus infection	Because two mammalian isoforms of iPLA2 (iPLA2beta and iPLA2gamma) have been cloned and characterized, the aim of this study was to identify the specific isoform(s) in macrophages that regulates the expression of iNOS in response to virus infection.
iPLA2	virus infection	cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is one downstream target of iPLA2 that is required for the transcriptional activation of iNOS in response to virus infection, and consistent with the effects of BEL enantiomers on iNOS expression, (S)-BEL more effectively inhibits EMCV-induced CREB phosphorylation than (R)-BEL in macrophages.
iPLA2	virus infection	Using macrophages isolated from iPLA2beta-null mice, virus infection fails to stimulate iNOS mRNA accumulation and protein expression, thus providing genetic evidence that iPLA2beta is required for EMCV-induced iNOS expression.
iPLA2	virus infection	Specific attention will be placed on the ability of virus infection to activate multiple signaling cascades (such as PKR, MAPK, iPLA2, NF-kappaB) and how these pathways are integrated in the regulation of individual target gene expression.
ITGB8	PRCC	In comparison with PRCC1, PRCC2 cases showed upregulated expression of Alfa5-integrin (ITGA5) whereas the expression of Alfa6- (ITGA6) and Beta8-integrins (ITGB8) was downregulated.
Cnot7	obesity	HFD-fed mice lacking Cnot7 and Tob express elevated levels of Ucp1 mRNA in iWAT and are resistant to diet-induced obesity.
Cnot7	obesity	Thus, the Cnot7-Tob-BRF1 axis inhibits Ucp1 expression and contributes to obesity.
hCAF1	cancer	Since abnormal and unbalanced JAK/STAT activation is associated with immune disorders and cancer, hCAF1 could play a major role in innate immunity and oncogenesis, contributing to tumour escape.
Cnot7	male infertility	Our previous study (Nakamura et al., 2004) showed that deletion of the Cnot7 gene in mice caused almost no abnormal phenotypes except for male infertility, due to oligo-astheno-teratozoospermia.
neural cell adhesion molecule	L1 syndrome	Mutations in the gene encoding the neural cell adhesion molecule L1CAM cause several neurological disorders collectively referred to as L1 syndrome.
KL-6	rheumatoid arthritis	A 59-year-old woman receiving methotrexate and tacrolimus for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was referred to our hospital following bilateral ground-glass opacity observed in her chest X-ray and elevated serum KL-6.
KL-6	rheumatoid arthritis	During treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) with prednisolone, chest image findings improved in association with decreased KL-6 levels.
MUC1	arthritis	The results showed that treatment with the MUC1-MBP/BCG anti-tumor vaccine did not cause any organ toxicity, except for arthritis or local nodules induced by BCG in several rats.
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1	PCOS	To investigate leptin, adiponectin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) levels and their relationship with each other and metabolic parameters in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
VCAM-1	PCOS	Non-insulin resistant PCOS had significantly higher adiponectin and sVCAM-1 levels.
VCAM-1	PCOS	Increases in IL-6 and TNF-Alfa and adhesion molecules (E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) were also observed, particularly in the PCOS IR group, providing evidence that inflammation and oxidative stress are related in PCOS patients.
VCAM-1	PCOS	Inflammation in PCOS induces leukocyte-endothelium interactions and a simultaneous increase in IL-6, TNF-Alfa, E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.
Bcl-xL	chondrosarcoma	In conclusion, we disclosed a novel mechanism that JQ1 inhibits cell proliferation, induces cell senescence and apoptosis of chondrosarcoma cells through the regulation of the YAP/p21/c-Myc/Bcl-xL signaling axis.
Bcl-xL	chondrosarcoma	BH-3 mimetics ABT-737 and ABT-263 are synthetic small-molecule inhibitors of anti-apoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl2) and Bcl-xL, which play a critical role in survival of chondrosarcoma cells.
Bcl-xl	chondrosarcoma	Here we show that the IHh signal pathway was activated in chondrosarcoma, and knocking down the expression of Gli1 attenuated the disturbed IHh signal pathway, which not only suppressed cell proliferation and promoted G2/M cell cycle arrest but also enhanced cell apoptosis by downregulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl expression.
Bcl-xl	chondrosarcoma	As in conventional chondrosarcoma, antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, and/or Bcl-xl) were highly expressed in all subtypes.
Bcl-XL	chondrosarcoma	BPB induced upregulation of Bax, Bad and Bak, downregulation of Bcl-2, Bid and Bcl-XL and dysfunction of mitochondria in chondrosarcoma.
Bcl-XL	chondrosarcoma	EGCG induced upregulation of Bax and Bak, downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, and dysfunction of mitochondria in chondrosarcoma.
Bcl-XL	chondrosarcoma	FPTB induced up-regulation of Bax and Bak, down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and dysfunction of mitochondria in chondrosarcoma.
Bcl-xL	chondrosarcoma	This study aims to investigate the expression patterns of HIF-1Alfa in chondrosarcoma, and its association with clinicopathologic features, Bcl-xL expression, apoptosis index (AI), and overall survival of patients with chondrosarcoma.
Bcl-xL	chondrosarcoma	In eight patients with chondrosarcoma, increased expression of HIF-1Alfa and Bcl-xL was detected in chondrosarcoma tissues compared with the paired adjacent normal tissues.
Bcl-xL	chondrosarcoma	These findings suggest that increased HIF-1Alfa levels mediated up-regulation of Bcl-xL play a prominent role in evasion of apoptosis and tumor progression, and can be predictive for the prognosis in human chondrosarcoma.
STE	diabetes	Three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (3D-STE) was used to evaluate the improvement of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion on the left ventricular (LV) systolic function of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitu (T2DM).
STE	diabetes mellitus	To elucidate association of renal dysfunction (RD) with unfavorable outcomes of in-hospital and long-term (1 year) treatment stages of patients with ST-elevation (STE) myocardial infarction (MI) and concomitant diabetes mellitus (DM).
STE	diabetes mellitus	Multivariate regression analysis showed that GPLS and diabetes mellitus were independent predictors for complex NSTE-ACS.
STE	diabetes	No differences were observed between the two groups in baseline characteristics; except AS-STEMI group had more patients with diabetes and EA-STEMI group had more patients with family history of coronary artery disease.
STE	diabetes mellitus	To elucidate association of renal dysfunction (RD) with unfavorable outcomes of in-hospital and long-term (1 year) treatment stages of patients with ST-elevation (STE) myocardial infarction (M) and concomitant diabetes mellitus (DM).
STE	diabetes	Incidence of complicated diabetes (P &lt; 0.05), pre-PCI Killip &gt;= II (55.9% (19/34) vs. 26.8% (15/56), P &lt; 0.05) and multivessel disease (70.6% (24/34) vs. 35.7% (20/56), P &lt; 0.05) were significantly higher in group D than in group C. TIMI 3 and the opening time of IRA was similar between group A and group B and between group C and group D. The incidence of in-hospital MACE was significantly higher in group B than in group A (14.4% (13/90) vs. 3.0% (4/135), P &lt; 0.05) which was similar between group C and group D. Early (1 hour) but not late (24 hours) ST resolution post PCI is related to a favorable clinical outcome in STEMI patients.
SOX4	OSCC	Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting were performed to evaluate SOX4 expression between OLP and OLP-OSCC tissues and among oral cancer cell lines and normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOKs).
SOX4	OSCC	LC-MS/MS analysis showed that 88 proteins including SOX4 were only identified in OLP-OSCC FFPE tissues when compared to OLP FFPE tissues.
SOX4	OSCC	IHC confirmed that SOX4 expression was significantly higher in OLP-OSCC than OLP and Western blot analysis indicated that SOX4 was over-expressed in UM1/UM2 cells when compared to NHOKs.
SOX4	OSCC	Our study indicated that SOX4 is significantly upregulated in OLP-OSCC versus OLP tissues.
SOX4	OSCC	These findings suggest that SOX4 might be actively involved in the progression of OLP to OSCC.
SOX4	oral squamous cell carcinoma	This study evaluated whether SOX4 affects oncogenic behavior and chemoradiotherapy response in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells, and documented the relationship between its expression and prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
SOX4	OSCC	SOX4 expression in OSCC tissues was investigated by immunohistochemistry.
SOX4	OSCC	Immunostaining showed SOX4 protein was significantly increased in OSCC tissues compared with adjacent normal mucosa.
SOX4	OSCC	SOX4 expression was observed in 51.8 % of 85 OSCC tissues, and was significantly correlated with treatment failure (P = 0.032) and shorter overall survival (P = 0.036) in patients with OSCC.
SOX4	oral squamous cell carcinoma	This study was the first to investigate correlations between SOX4 expression levels and the clinicopathologic factors of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
SOX4	OSCC	We analyzed SOX4 expression levels in 50 patients with OSCC using immunohistochemistry.
SOX4	OSCC	The expression level of SOX4 in primary foci of poorly differentiated OSCC was higher than that of well differentiated OSCC, which indicated that SOX4 expression is associated with the differentiation of OSCC.
SOX4	OSCC	These results indicate that undifferentiated OSCC cells expressing SOX4 are more likely to metastasize and neoadjuvant therapy including chemoradiation therapy may have some effect in metastatic prevention.
SCTs	Cryptorchidism	Cryptorchidism was significantly associated with development of MGCSCTs, SCTs, and SEMs, but not ICTs (p&lt;0.01).
NGF R	leprosy	Since nerve functions are affected by inflammatory response during the course of leprosy, changes in the production of NGF and its receptor (NGF R) may be directly associated with disability and sensory loss.
NGFR	tuberculoid leprosy	Skin biopsies were collected and submitted to immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies to IL-17, NGF and NGF R. Quantitative analysis of NGF, NGFR and IL-17 immunostaining showed a significant difference between the clinical forms, with higher expression of NGF and NGFR in lepromatous leprosy and IL-17 in tuberculoid leprosy.
CD271	tuberculosis	The recovered CD271(+) BM-MSCs from post-therapy mice, when injected into healthy mice, caused active tuberculosis infection in the animal's lung.
CD271	pulmonary tuberculosis	Next, in human subjects, previously treated for pulmonary tuberculosis, the MTB-containing CD271(+) BM-MSCs exhibited high expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1Alfa and low expression of CD146, a hypoxia down-regulated cell surface marker of human BM-MSCs.
CD271	tuberculosis	The bone marrow niche of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within CD271(+) BM-MSCs stem cells is the proposed explanation for the localized cortical resorption that is observed in bone stress markers.
NGF-R	leprosy	Therefore, the objective of this study was to correlate the immunoexpression patterns of NGF and NGF-R in the different clinical forms of leprosy, and to associate the findings with the in situ expression of TGF-Beta and clinical classification of the disease.
NGF-R	leprosy	There was a significant positive correlation between NGF and NGF-R in the different clinical forms of leprosy.
CD271	tuberculosis	Moreover, most viable M. tuberculosis was recovered from the bone marrow CD271(+)CD45(-)-enriched cell fraction, and only few viable bacteria could be isolated from the CD271(-)CD45(+) cell fraction.
Ngfr	influenza	We recently developed a systems biological approach to vaccine safety evaluation where identification of specific biomarkers in a rat pre-clinical study evaluated the safety of vaccines for pandemic H5N1 influenza including Irf7, Lgals9, Lgalsbp3, Cxcl11, Timp1, Tap2, Psmb9, Psme1, Tapbp, C2, Csf1, Mx2, Zbp1, Ifrd1, Trafd1, Cxcl9, Beta2m, Npc1, Ngfr and Ifi47.
MdmX	cancer	MdmX overexpression contributes to the development of cancer by inhibiting tumor suppressor p53.
MdmX	melanoma	A switch in the alternative splicing of MdmX transcript, leading to the inclusion of exon 6, has been identified as the primary mechanism responsible for increased MdmX protein levels in human cancers, including melanoma.
MdmX	cancer	Recent studies showed that interfering with cellular splicing machinery can result in MdmX downregulation in cancer cells.
MdmX	melanoma	We, therefore, hypothesized that enoxacin could, by modulating miRNAs targeting splicing machinery, activate p53 in melanoma cells overexpressing MdmX.
MdmX	melanoma	Not only in melanoma, but also in MCF7 breast carcinoma and A2780 ovarian carcinoma cells overexpressing MdmX.
MdmX	cancer	Together, our results suggest that some clinically approved fluoroquinolones could potentially be repurposed as activators of p53 tumor suppressor in cancers overexpressing MdmX oncoprotein and that p53 activation might contribute to the previously reported activity of enoxacin towards human cancer cells.
MDMX	cancer	These will be discussed as will recent findings of MDMX inhibitors: these are of special importance as it has been shown that cancers that become resistant to MDM2 inhibitors often amplify MDM4.
MDM4	melanoma	We speculate that E3 ubiquitin ligases MDM2 and MDM4 can be attractive therapeutic target for p53 and Notch signaling pathways in malignant melanoma by using small molecule inhibitors.
RCPs	gallbladder cancer	Our recent studies conducted in South America have shown that mycotoxin contamination of red chili peppers (RCPs) may be associated with an increased risk of gallbladder cancer (GBC).
DDX48	vaginal carcinoma	Three proteins were uniquely altered in vaginal carcinoma (DDX48, erbB3-binding protein and biliverdin reductase) and five in cervical carcinoma (peroxiredoxin 2, annexin A2, sarcomeric tropomyosin kappa, human ribonuclease inhibitor and prolyl-4-hydrolase beta).
NARP	retinitis pigmentosa	Mitochondrial (mt) DNA-associated NARP (neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa) syndrome is due to mutation in the MT-ATP6 gene.
NARP	retinitis pigmentosa	Pathogenic mutations in MT-ATP6 are associated with the Leigh syndrome, the syndrome of neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), as well as with non-classical phenotypes, while MT-ATP8 is less frequently mutated in patients with mitochondrial disease.
NARP	retinitis pigmentosa	Analysis of these populations demonstrated an altered metabolic signature in cells harbouring decreased levels of mutant m.8993T&gt;G mtDNA, associated with neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP).
NARP	retinitis pigmentosa	Neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) is caused by m.8993T&gt;G/C mutations in the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthase subunit 6 gene (MT-ATP6).
NARP	retinitis pigmentosa	In addition, we successfully reduced human mutated mtDNA levels responsible for Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHOND), and neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), in mammalian oocytes using mitochondria-targeted TALEN (mito-TALENs).
NARP	Retinitis Pigmentosa	Based on our previous findings that ROS level was higher in human osteosarcoma cybrids--Neuropathy, Ataxia and Retinitis Pigmentosa (NARP) and was reduced by selenite treatment, this study was designed to elucidate the effects of selenite administration on oxidative and nitrosative damage to lipids, proteins and DNA.
NARP	retinitis pigmentosa	We report a patient having classical clinical feature of neurologic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) and a novel mutation, m.8729 G&gt;A in mitochondria DNA.
NARP	retinitis pigmentosa	His mother, who had previously been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, was concurrently diagnosed with neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) due to heteroplasmy of the same mutation.
NARP	retinitis pigmentosa	In this issue, Gammage and colleagues successfully apply this improved technology on patients' cells with two types of genetic alterations responsible for neuropathy ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP) syndrome and Kearns Sayre syndrome and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO).
NARP	retinitis pigmentosa	There are several diseases that have a mitochondrial origin such as chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) and the Kearns- Sayre syndrome (KSS), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes (MELAS), Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), the syndrome of neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), and Leigh's syndrome.
myb-as	Neuroblastoma	Neuroblastoma cells treated with free myb-as or nontargeted CCL-myb-as showed the same level of c-myb protein expression as control cells.
myb-as	neuroblastoma	Immune cell activation, involving the time-dependent activation of macrophages and NK cells, contributes to the antitumor activity of targeted liposome-CpG-myb-as against neuroblastoma and could improve the effectiveness of antitumor targeted liposomes.
YY1	neuroblastoma	While YY1 is known to exert both positive and negative regulatory influences on nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, as well as on neurodegeneration-related genes, in all cell lines we studied (including neuroblastoma) the effect of YY1 on GDAP1 expression is activatory.
YY1	neuroblastoma	Using the DBH-expressing human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE(2)C and DBH-negative HeLa cell lines as model systems, we report here that this CRE/YY1/AP1 area interacts with multiple nuclear proteins, including CRE-binding protein (CREB) and transcription factor YY1 in a cell-specific manner.
CD44	Gastric Carcinoma	However, little is known about the expression of CD44v6 in Gastric Carcinoma (GC).
CD44	stomach cancer	Multiple carcinomas including breast, ovarian, colon, lung and stomach cancer, overexpress the hyaluronic acid (HA) receptor, CD44.
CD44	Gastric Adenocarcinoma	Here, we show that the transcription of a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), Gastric Adenocarcinoma Associated, Positive CD44 Regulator, Long Intergenic Non-Coding RNA (GAPLINC), is directly activated by HIF-1Alfa in gastric cancer (GC).
CD44	gastric carcinoma	The expressions of 10 putative cell surface markers of CSCs, as well as aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, were studied, and the tumorigenic properties of cells were evaluated by in vitro tumorsphere assays and in vivo xenografts by limiting dilution assays.Results: We found that a subpopulation of gastric carcinoma cells expressing EPCAM, CD133, CD166, CD44, and a high ALDH activity presented the properties to generate new heterogeneous tumorspheres in vitro and tumors in vivo CD44 and CD166 were coexpressed, representing 6.1% to 37.5% of the cells; ALDH activity was detected in 1.6% to 15.4% of the cells; and the ALDH+ cells represented a core within the CD44+/CD166+ subpopulation that contained the highest frequency of tumorigenic CSCs in vivo The ALDH+ cells possessed drug efflux properties and were more resistant to standard chemotherapy than the ALDH- cells, a process that was partially reversed by verapamil treatment.Conclusions: CD44 and ALDH are the most specific biomarkers to detect and isolate tumorigenic and chemoresistant gastric CSCs in noncardia gastric carcinomas independently of the histologic classification of the tumor.
CD10	ovarian cancer	Clinically, low CD10 expression was consistent with a specific set of ovarian cancer patient samples.
CD10	ovarian cancer	Furthermore, our data indicate that primary stage targeting of CD10-/ALDH- CSCs in specific ovarian cancer patients in future may facilitate targeting of recurrent disease, before it ever develops.
CD10	endometrial stromal tumor	All cases were negative for CD10 and WT-1 ruling out endometrial stromal tumor and were negative for HMB-45 and melan-A ruling out perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (both endometrial stromal tumor and perivascular epithelioid cell tumor have prominent vessels but have different histomorphology).
CD10	uterine tumor	Immunohistochemistry indicated a phenotypic transition from a uterine leiomyosarcoma to a vaginal epithelioid lesion; marker expression changed from the uterine tumor actin+/desmin+/caldesmon+/CD10- phenotype, through the tumor emboli, to an actin-/desmin-/caldesmon-/CD10+ phenotype in the vaginal lesion.
CD10	ESS	Immunohistochemistry for IFITM1 and CD10 was performed in 20 cases of smooth muscle neoplasms (10 cases leiomyoma, 10 cases leiomyosarcoma), 14 cases of endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) (12 cases of low grade and 2 cases of high grade) and 12 cases of carcinosarcoma.
CD10	ESS	While both IFITM1 (83%) and CD10 (91%) had high sensitivity in differentiating low-grade ESSs from smooth muscle neoplasms, IFITM1 (70%) had higher specificity compared with CD10 (45%).
CD10	ESS	In this study IFITM1 appears to be a more specific marker of endometrial stromal differentiation compared with CD10 in differentiating low-grade ESSs from smooth muscle neoplasms.
HLA-DRB1	alopecia areata	To further evaluate the nature of the HLA association with alopecia areata (AA), we investigated the HLA-DRB1 locus in 161 AA patients and 165 matched controls from Belgium and Germany.
miR-19a	renal carcinoma	In the present study, we found that miR-19a expression was significantly upregulated in metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma than that in adjacent and primary carcinoma tissues using qPCR and in situ hybridization experiments.
miR-19a	renal carcinoma	Thus, we provide evidence demonstrating that downregulation of miR-19a may be therapeutically beneficial for metastatic renal carcinoma.
miR-19a	bladder cancer	Taqman probe stem-loop real-time PCR was used to accurately measure the levels of miR-19a in bladder cancer cell lines, 100 pairs of bladder cancer tissues and the adjacent non-neoplastic tissues and also the plasma collected from bladder cancer patients and normal controls.
miR-19a	bladder cancer	miR-19a mimics and inhibitors were transfected into bladder cancer cells to investigate its role on regulating cell proliferation which was measured by CCK-8 and colony formation assay.
miR-19a	bladder cancer	miR-19a was significantly up-regulated in bladder cancer tissues and high-level of miR-19a was correlative with more aggressive phenotypes of bladder cancer.
miR-19a	bladder cancer	Meanwhile, gain or loss of function of miR-19a demonstrated that miR-19a can promote cell growth of bladder cancer cells and the further mechanism studies indicated that its oncogenic role was dependent on targeting PTEN.
miR-19a	bladder cancer	Furthermore, investigation of miR-19a expression in the plasma of bladder cancer patients showed that miR-19a was also increased in plasma of bladder cancer patients which strongly supported miR-19a could be developed as potential diagnostic marker of bladder cancer.
miR-19a	bladder cancer	Our data indicated that miR-19a might act as an oncogenic microRNA in bladder cancer and was significantly up-regulated in bladder cancer carcinogenesis.
miR19a	bladder cancer	The oncogenic role of miR19a in bladder cancer was dependent on targeting PTEN.
mir-19a	bladder cancer	The synergy effect between miRNA-19a and arsenic trioxide that advocates targeting the mir-19a may represent a potential approach to enhance the efficacy and safety of ATO to treat bladder cancer by a decrease in dose.
ceruloplasmin	schistosomiasis	There was significant decreases in serum albumin and haptoglobin and increases in alpha-1 globulin, ceruloplasmin and alpha-1 globulin, there were no significant differences between schistosomiasis patients and the controls in terms of changes in any laboratory test as a result of the treatment, thus suggesting that patients with active schistosomiasis do not incur a higher risk of hepatic dysfunction while using oral contraception.
ICAM-1	macular hole	Aqueous flare values and the vitreous levels of VEGF, IL-6, MCP-1, sICAM-1, and sVEGFR-2 were compared between previously untreated patients with BRVO and patients with macular hole (MH).
intercellular adhesion molecule-1	macular hole	We investigated the relations between the aqueous flare value and vitreous levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients with CRVO and macular edema or patients with idiopathic macular hole (MH).
ICAM-1	macular hole	Vitreous fluid levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble VEGF receptor 2 (sVEGFR-2), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) were significantly higher in CRVO patients than in macular hole patients.
ICAM-1	macular hole	In 39 patients with BRVO and macular edema and 21 individuals with idiopathic macular hole (MH) serving as controls, vitreous fluid samples were obtained during vitreoretinal surgery, and the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble VEGF receptor 2 (sVEGFR-2), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
ICAM-1	macular hole	To investigate relationships among vitreous fluid levels of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (sVEGFR-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and macular edema or patients with idiopathic macular hole.
ICAM-1	macular hole	BRVO patients had a significantly higher vitreous fluid level of sVEGFR-2 (median, 1670 pg/mL; interquartile range [IQL], 1205 to 2225 pg/mL) than macular hole patients (median, 1265 pg/mL; IQR, 731 to 1800 pg/mL; P = .017), as was the case for VEGF (median, 237 pg/mL; IQR, 42.2 to 1305 pg/mL; vs median, 15.6 pg/mL; IQR, 15.6 to 15.6 pg/mL; P &lt; .001) and sICAM-1 (median, 10.1 ng/mL; IQR, 6.3 to 22.5 ng/mL; vs median, 4.1 ng/mL; IQR, 3.3 to 6.0 ng/mL; P &lt; .001).
ICAM-1	macular hole	Vitreous levels of sICAM-1 were significantly increased in vitreous specimens from both PVR (median +/- SD; 12.0 +/- 76.3 ng/ml; P &lt; 0.01) and PDR (8.4 +/- 24.0 ng/ml; P &lt; 0.01) when compared to vitreous from eyes with macular holes (0.
ICAM-1	macular hole	Levels of sICAM-1 in this group were compared with those in vitreous from 31 eyes with RRD without clinical risk factors for PVR, 32 eyes with established PVR and 10 eyes with macular holes.
ICAM-1	macular hole	Vitreous sICAM-1 levels in eyes with RRD at high risk of developing PVR were significantly lower than in eyes with established PVR (p=0.037), but higher than in eyes with macular holes (p &lt;0.0001).
PDDR	hyperchylomicronemia	Rare pathogenic alleles with high penetrance and associated haplotypes at 10 loci (CFTR, FAH, HBB, HEXA, LDLR, LPL, PAH, PABP2, PDDR, and SACS) are expressed in probands with cystic fibrosis, tyrosinemia, beta-thalassemia, Tay-Sachs, familial hypercholesterolemia, hyperchylomicronemia, PKU, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, pseudo vitamin D deficiency rickets, and spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay, respectively) reveal the interpopulation and intrapopulation genetic diversity of Quebec.
TCERG1	Huntington's disease	Biochemical, neuropathological, and genetic evidence suggests an important role for TCERG1 in Huntington's disease (HD) pathogenesis.
Atg8a	cancer	Further investigations on the underlying mechanisms showed that the depletion of dG9a repressed starvation-induced autophagy by controlling the expression level of Atg8a, a critical gene for the progression of autophagy, in a different manner to that in cancer cells.
GABARAP	cancer	Bioinformatic analysis of human tumours revealed that several core autophagy genes, including GABARAP, correlate with oncogenic KRAS mutations and poor prognosis in human pancreatic cancer, supporting a potential tumour-suppressive effect of the pathway in Ras-driven human cancers.
GABARAP	thyroid cancer	Using a yeast two-hybrid screening approach, based on a thyroid cancer patients library, we showed that CDH6 directly interacts with GABARAP, BNIP3 and BNIP3L, and that through these interactions CDH6 restrains autophagy and promotes re-organization of mitochondrial network through a DRP1-mediated mechanism.
GABARAP	cancer	We previously reported that GABARAPL1 expression was frequently downregulated in cancer cells while a high GABARAPL1 expression is a good prognosis marker for patients with lymph node-positive breast cancer.
GABARAP	cancer	In this study, we asked using qRT-PCR, western blotting and epigenetic quantification whether the expression of the GABARAP family was regulated in breast cancer by epigenetic modifications.
GABARAP	cancer	Our data demonstrated that a specific decrease of GABARAPL1 expression in breast cancers was associated with both DNA methylation and histone deacetylation and that CREB-1 recruitment on GABARAPL1 promoter was required for GABARAPL1 expression.
MYH10	platelet disorder	Here we demonstrate that runx1 deletion in mice induces the persistence of MYH10 in platelets, and a similar persistence was observed in platelets of patients with constitutional (familial platelet disorder/acute myeloid leukemia) or acquired (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia) RUNX1 mutations.
MYH10	thrombocytopenia	MYH10 was also detected in platelets of patients with the Paris-Trousseau syndrome, a thrombocytopenia related to the deletion of the transcription factor FLI1 that forms a complex with RUNX1 to regulate megakaryopoiesis, whereas MYH10 persistence was not observed in other inherited forms of thrombocytopenia.
MYH10	platelet disorder	We propose MYH10 detection as a new and simple tool to identify inherited platelet disorders and myeloid neoplasms with abnormalities in RUNX1 and its associated proteins.

PD-L1	anaplastic large cell lymphoma	PD-L1 staining was detected in 80% of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and follicular dendritic cell sarcoma, 75% of nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, 53% of primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, 39% of extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, 26% of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, 10% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and very rare examples of mantle, marginal zone and small lymphocytic lymphomas.
PD-L1	ALCL	PD-L1 also showed stronger expression in ALK+ ALCL compared with ALK- ALCL, suggesting an additional role of C/EBPBeta in ALK+ ALCL in generating an immunosuppressive environment.
PD-L1	ALCL	In conclusion, surface antigen expression profiling demonstrates that C/EBPBeta plays a critical role in the activation state of ALK+ ALCL cells and reveals CD147 and PD-L1 as important downstream targets.
PD-L1	anaplastic large cell lymphoma	Also, the neoplastic cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, schwannoma, thymoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of various sites frequently expressed PD-L1.
PD-L1	anaplastic large-cell lymphoma	These unique features, which are strictly dependent on NPM-ALK activity and expression, include perpetual cell growth, proliferation, and survival; activation of the key signal transduction pathways STAT3 and mTORC1; and expression of CD30 (the hallmark of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma) and of immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 and cell-surface protein PD-L1/CD274.
PD-L1	ALCL	PD-L1 was expressed uniformly by anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines, but rarely in B-cell NHL, confined to a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) with activated B-cell features (3 of 28 cell lines and 24% of primary DLBCL).
PD-L1	ALCL	Anti-PD-L1 blocking antibody boosted proliferation and IFN-Gamma secretion by allogeneic T cells responding to ALCL and DLBCL cells.
PD-L1	ALCL	In autologous cultures of primary ALCL and DLBCL, PD-L1 blockade enhanced secretion of inflammatory cytokines IFN-Gamma, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, TNF-Alfa, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1Alfa.
B7-H1	ALCL	We examined B7-H1 expression in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and found that it was constitutively expressed in both clinical samples and cell lines.
B7-H1	ALCL	In anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK(+)) ALCL cells, B7-H1 expression was suppressed by the blocking of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and upregulated by the augmentation of ERK activity by phorbol 13-myristate 12-acetate stimulation, suggesting that B7-H1 expression is regulated by ERK signaling pathway in ALCL.
B7-H1	ALCL	ERK is one of the downstream mediators of nucleophosmin (NPM)/ALK signaling in ALK(+)ALCL, and pharmacological inhibition of ALK was shown to dephosphorylate ERK and down-regulate B7-H1.
B7-H1	ALCL	The involvement of NPM/ALK in B7-H1 expression was also demonstrated by introducing the construct into human non-ALCL lymphoid cell lines, which resulted in B7-H1 expression.
B7-H1	ALCL	These results suggest that B7-H1 expression is controlled by common ERK signaling pathways in ALCL and HL cells.
MYH9	Fabry's syndrome	The applicability of clinical genetics in nephrology is due to the fact that many kidney diseases are characterized by genetic mutations (e.g., von-Hippel Lindau syndrome, MYH9 related disorders, Fabry's syndrome, Liddle's and Bartter's Syndrome, and others).
MYH9	diabetes	In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a common single nucleotide polymorphism rs16996677 in the MYH9 gene may contribute to the etiology of DN in type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a Taiwanese population with T2D.
sFRP-2	multiple myeloma	It has been demonstrated that Wnt signaling through the secretion of Wnt inhibitors, such as DKK1, sFRP-2, and sFRP-3, plays a key role in the decreased osteoblast activity associated with multiple myeloma (MM) bone disease.
SFRP2	essential thrombocythaemia	The authors studied the methylation status of CDKN2A, CDKN2B, XAF1, CDH13, JUNB and a panel of soluble Wnt inhibitors including WIF1, DKK3, APC, SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4 and SFRP5 by methylation-specific PCR in 31 bone marrow and 21 peripheral blood samples of patients with essential thrombocythaemia.
SFRP2	myeloma	We studied the activity of Wnt signaling and the methylation status of WIF1, DKK3, APC, SFRP1, SFRP2, SFRP4 and SFRP5 by methylation-specific PCR in myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma samples.
sFRP-2	myeloma	On the other hand, myeloma cells suppress osteoblast function by the secretion of osteoblast inhibiting factors, e.g., the Wnt inhibitors DKK-1 and sFRP-2.
HHIP1	pancreatic cancer	Hedgehog signaling is frequently activated in esophageal cancer, gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer due to transcriptional upregulation of Hedgehog ligands and epigenetic silencing of HHIP1/HHIP gene, encoding the Hedgehog inhibitor.
Sel-1-like	pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma	Sel-1-like (SEL1L) is a putative tumor suppressor gene that is significantly downregulated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).
SEL1L	pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma	SEL1L is a putative tumor suppressor gene that is frequently down-regulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).
SEL-1L	pancreatic tumor	Using a functional genomic approach, we identified a seven-gene panel (TNC, TFPI, TGFBI, SEL-1L, L1CAM, WWTR1, and CDC42BPA) that was differentially expressed across three different expression platforms, including pancreatic tumor/normal samples.
SEL1L	pancreatic tumor	Previously, it was reported that SEL1L is able to decrease the aggressive behavior of human pancreatic tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo.
SEL1L	pancreatic cancer	To gain insights into the involvement of SEL1L in tumor invasion, we performed gene expression analysis on the pancreatic cancer cell line Suit-2 subjected to two complementary strategies: upregulation and downregulation of SEL1L expression by stable transfection of the entire cDNA under an inducible promoter and by RNA-mediated interference.
SEL1L	pancreatic cancer	The gene SEL1L is involved both in human breast and pancreatic cancer progression.
SEL1L	pancreatic carcinoma	Recent data suggest that SEL1L may play an important role in pancreatic carcinoma, similar to breast cancer, where the expression of SEL1L has been associated with a reduction in both proliferative activity in vitro and clinical tumor aggressiveness.
Sel1L	pancreatic carcinoma	To investigate this possibility, we examined the expression of Sel1L in a series of primary pancreatic carcinomas by immunohistochemistry and characterized the effects of Sel1L overexpression both in vitro and in vivo.
Sel1L	pancreatic cancer	In 74 pancreatic cancers analysed, 36% lacked Sel1L expression, although there was no significant correlation between the expression of Sel1L and any clinicopathologic parameter, including survival.
SEL1L	pancreatic cancer	Overexpression of SEL1L in stably transfected pancreatic cancer cells caused both a decrease in clonogenicity and anchorage-independent growth as well as a significant increase in the levels of activin A and SMAD4.
Sel1L	pancreatic carcinoma	Thus, it can be hypothesized that Sel1L plays an important function in the growth and aggressiveness of pancreatic carcinoma.

IL-4	optic neuropathy	We have reported previously that ocular infection of different strains of mice with recombinant herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) constitutively expressing interleukin-2 (IL-2) provokes central nervous system (CNS) demyelination and optic neuropathy, as determined by changes in visual evoked cortical potentials and pathological changes in the optic nerve and CNS, whereas recombinant viruses expressing IL-4, gamma interferon, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, or IL-12p70 do not induce this neuropathy.
IL-4	optic neuritis	The objective of this study was to detect interleukin-17 (IL-17), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and forkhead/winged helix transcription factor p3 (Foxp3) protein and gene expression of the optic nerve and to further explore the role of T helper cell subsets such as Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg in the pathogenesis of optic neuritis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).

GKN1	adenocarcinomas	Loss of GKN1 and GKN2 expression occurs frequently in gastric adenocarcinomas, especially in the diffuse subtype.
RIs	hypertension	Since RIs significantly correlate with renal function, they have been proposed to be independent risk factors for CKD progression, besides proteinuria, low GFR and arterial hypertension.
RIs	preeclampsia	High uterine artery Doppler resistance indexes (RIs) are predictive of placental complications of pregnancy, such as preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth.
RIs	hypertension	Patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus showed higher RIs (p &lt; 0.05) than those without the ailments.
JMML	anemia	Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and myeloproliferative disorders are rare in children; they are divided into low-grade MDS (refractory cytopenia of childhood [RCC]), advanced MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation), and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), each with different characteristics and management strategies.
Shp2	anemia	Thus, genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of Shp2 suppresses the leukemogenic effect of Pten loss, yet simultaneously induces severe anemia in mice with Pten deficiency in blood cells.
Shp2	anemia	Surprisingly, the Shp2 and Pten double-knockout mice suffered lethal anemia, a phenotype that reveals previously unappreciated cooperative roles of Pten and Shp2 in erythropoiesis.
Shp2	anemia	Consistently, treatment of Pten-deficient mice with a specific Shp2 inhibitor suppressed myeloproliferative neoplasm while causing anemia.

FGF23	hypogonadism	Recent studies using genetically modified mice, such as FGF23-/- and Klotho-/- mice that exhibit altered mineral homeostasis due to a high vitamin D activity showed features of premature aging that include retarded growth, osteoporosis, atherosclerosis, ectopic calcification, immunological deficiency, skin and general organ atrophy, hypogonadism and short lifespan.
Fgf23	hypogonadism	Moreover, Fgf23(-/-)/klotho(-/-) mice show soft tissue and vascular calcification, severe muscle wasting, hypogonadism, pulmonary emphysema, distention of intestinal wall, and skin atrophy, all of which are also seen in Fgf23(-/-) and klotho(-/-) mice.
Fgf-23	hypogonadism	Recent studies using genetically altered mouse models, such as in Fgf-23(-/-) and klotho mutant mice, that exhibit altered mineral ion metabolism due to high vitamin D activities showed features of premature aging that include atherosclerosis, emphysema, osteopenia/osteoporosis, hypogonadism, soft tissue calcifications and generalized atrophy of organs; the pathologic effects of vitamin D in these mouse models are obvious, as diminution or genetic ablation of the vitamin D pathway ameliorated most of the above-mentioned phenotypes, by reversing mineral ion metabolism, and the resultant effect being prolonged survival of the mutant mice.

HTR2A	OSAS	Of the 5-HTR2A 1438G/A gene polymorphism, the AA genotype increased the OSAS risk, with an OR of 4.21 (95% CI: 2.83-6.25) in a recessive model in male OSAS patients, but no significant association was found in females.
HTR2A	OSAS	Our meta-analysis demonstrated that polymorphisms in the 5-HTR2A 1438G/A and 5-HTT genes contributed to susceptibility to OSAS.
5-HT2A	obstructive sleep apnea	The serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor has been implicated in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
TRPC5	hypertension	Our findings suggest that upregulated functional TRPC5 gene may be one cause of EPO-induced hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease.
TTR	spinal stenosis	TTR (transthyretin) gene could be a possible candidate for lumbosacral stenosis in Labrador retrievers based on previous human studies that have reported an association between human lumbar spinal stenosis and transthyretin protein amyloidosis.
TTR	spinal stenosis	Wild-type ATTR amyloidosis mainly involves the heart, although the reported occurrence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, spinal stenosis and biceps tendon rupture in these patients speaks to more generalized protein deposition.
prostaglandin I2	cardiac arrest	In all groups, but the HBD group, the livers were pretreated with FK506 and prostaglandin I2 analogue, and were preserved in University of Wisconsin solution after cardiac arrest.
prostaglandin I2	primary pulmonary hypertension	We used a new vasodilator, TTC-909 (a prostaglandin I2 analog incorporated in lipid microspheres), which produced marked reduction in the pulmonary arterial pressure and resistance in an infant with primary pulmonary hypertension.
prostaglandin I2	cardiac arrest	A prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) was administered before cardiac arrest by St. Thomas solution.
Prostaglandin I2	primary pulmonary hypertension	Recently, with the introduction of prostacyclin (Prostaglandin I2, epoprostenon) as a potent vasodilator, several reports have shown a positive effect in primary pulmonary hypertension.
GLI3	glioma	Furthermore, the involvement of functional GREM1 in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of glioma was investigated by detecting the expression levels of glioma-associated oncogene homologue 3 (GLI3) and EMT-related molecules.
GLI3	Glioblastoma multiforme	Suppression of GLI1/GLI2 functions by a C-terminus truncated GLI3 repressor mutant (GLI3R), or by GANT61, a pharmacological inhibitor of GLI1/GLI2, reduced hTERT protein expression in human colon cancer, prostate cancer and Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell lines.
DNA binding protein	GBM	Inhibitor of DNA binding protein-1 (ID1) has been shown to maintain the self-renewal capacity of neural stem cells and might be involved in the therapeutic resistance of GBM.
DNA binding protein	GBM	In glioblastoma neurosphere cultures that contain cancer stem cells (GBM-CSCs), the bHLH family member inhibitors of DNA binding protein 2 and 4 (Id2 and Id4) were found to be upregulated during the differentiation of GBM-CSCs in response to histone deacetylase inhibitors.
3 vs -1	mitral regurgitation	The improvement in mitral regurgitation was greater for the mitral repair group (-2.1 +/- 0.3 vs -1.1 +/- 0.8, P &lt; .0001), and mitral regurgitation remained significantly lower on follow-up at 6 months or more (0.6 +/- 0.4 0.9 +/- 0.2, P = .002).

BKLF	HS2	In a functional analysis, transient cotransfections in nonerythroid NIH/3T3 cells of SP1, SP3, BKLF, or EKLF and HS2 epsilony promoter-luciferase constructs, with or without coactivators (p300, CREB-binding protein [CBP], or p300/CBP-associated factor [PCAF]) and SCFAs, were performed.
Ngb	brain infarction	Using our newly created Ngb overexpressing transgenic (Ngb-Tg) mice, we measured brain infarction on day 1 and day 14 after transient focal cerebral ischemia and performed neurobehavioral assessments in sensorimotor deficits on days 1, 3, 7, and 14.
Ngb	brain infarction	Compared with wild-type controls, brain infarction volumes 1 day and 14 days after transient focal cerebral ischemia were significantly reduced in Ngb-Tg mice.
Ngb	cerebral infarct	Evidence includes the observations that neuronal hypoxia and cerebral ischemia induce Ngb expression, that enhancing Ngb expression reduces--and knocking down Ngb expression increases--hypoxic neuronal injury in vitro and ischemic cerebral injury in vivo, and that Ngb-overexpressing transgenic mice are resistant to cerebral infarction.
per i	influenza	Sono stati presentati i casi di un effetto paradosso di aggressivita sotto la possibile influenza di acepromazina e un protocollo modificato per il trattamento di un avvelenamento da permetrina nei gatti.

HSP70	Influenza	AR-12-stimulated the co-localization of Influenza, EBV and HIV virus proteins with LC3 in autophagosomes and reduced viral protein association with the chaperones HSP90, HSP70, and GRP78.
HSP70	influenza	Hence, in agreement with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) acting as Th1 cytokine-like adjuvant, an Escherichia coli-expressed r4M2e.HSP70c fusion protein comprising C-terminus of Mycobacterium tuberculosis HSP70 genetically fused to four tandem repeats of influenza A virus M2e was constructed.
HSP70	influenza	Furthermore, a virus challenge experiment revealed that mice vaccinated with r4M2e.HSP70c limited the severity of influenza A disease by 100% survival rate, less sever body weight loss and delaying the onset of morbidity in mice for 2days rather than other control groups.
HSP70	influenza	To prepare an effective vaccine against influenza A viruses, a chimerical DNA plasmid encoding Influenza virus M2 protein and Leishmania major HSP70 was constructed.
HSP70	influenza	Our previous study have shown that a prime-boost administration of recombinant 4xM2e.HSP70c (r4M2e/H70c) fusion protein compared to conventional HA-based influenza vaccines provided full protection against lethal dose of influenza A viruses in mice.
HSP70	influenza	The data reported herein show that protection against H9N2 viral challenge was significantly increased in chickens by injection of r4M2e/H70c compared with injection of conventional HA-based influenza vaccine adjuvanted with MF59 or recombinant 4xM2e (r4M2e) without HSP70c.
HSP70	influenza	This protective immunity might be attributed to enhanced cell-mediated immunity, which is interpreted as increased lymphocytes proliferation, increased levels of Th1-type (IFN-Gamma) and Th2-type (IL-4) cytokines production and increased CD4(+) to CD8(+) ratios, resulting from the injection of four tandem repeats of the ectodomain of the conserved influenza matrix protein M2 (4xM2e) genetically fused to C-terminus of Mycobacterium tuberculosis HSP70 (mHSP70c).
Hsp70	influenza	Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was identified as a cellular interaction partner of the influenza virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex.
Hsp70	influenza	Here we demonstrated that Hsp70 was involved in the regulation of influenza A viral transcription and replication.
Hsp70	influenza	Furthermore, delivered Hsp70 could inhibit the replication of influenza A virus in mice.
Hsp70	influenza	In this study, antigenic peptides from tetanus toxin and influenza hemagglutinin complexed to human stress-inducible Hsp70 were found to enhance the proliferation and cytokine production of human antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells.
HSP70	influenza	Herein, to construct a recombinant M2e-based vaccine candidate with the appropriate structural conformation and immunogenicity the corresponding nucleotide sequence from an H9N2 influenza strain was fused to the N-terminus of the truncated Mycobacterium tuberculosis HSP70(359-610), as a potent adjuvant, and following its cloning into the pPICZ alpha A plasmid the fusion gene was expressed in Pichia pastoris KM71H yeast.
HSP70	influenza	According to previous reports, this study was designed to produce a novel influenza A virus recombinant fusion protein consisted of M2e, a potent immunogenic protein from influenza A virus, fused to C-terminal domain of mycobacterium tuberculosis HSP70, HSP70(359-610), as a carrier and adjuvant.

PPM1l	obesity	The protein phosphatase 1-like gene (PPM1l) was identified as causal gene for obesity and metabolic abnormalities in mice.
Ppm1l	obesity	Three genes in this network, lipoprotein lipase (Lpl), lactamase beta (Lactb) and protein phosphatase 1-like (Ppm1l), are validated as previously unknown obesity genes, strengthening the association between this network and metabolic disease traits.
FoxO1	osteoporosis	Based on previous research, we hypothesized that RES regulates FoxO1 transcriptional activity through the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway to achieve an antioxidative effect on osteoporosis and then we confirmed this hypothesis in the present study.
FoxO1	osteoporosis	FoxO1 is a major action target of RES to confer anti-osteoporosis function, and whose effect stems from its power to improve redox balance.
FoxO1	osteoporosis	But whether FoxO1 is involved in the oxidative damage during osteoporosis is largely unknown.
FoxO1	osteoporosis	In conclusion, our study revealed that the decline of FoxO1 is an important etiology factor of osteoporosis and unclosed a novel mechanism of FoxO1 regulation by TNF-Alfa.

E-selectin	diabetic retinopathy	We found a significant increase in levels of adhesion molecules (VCAM-1) and selectins (E-selectin) in parallel with increased severity of diabetic retinopathy, with a significant difference of inflammatory markers between stages of retinopathy.
E-selectin	diabetic retinopathy	Our aim was to investigate the role of soluble E-selectin in the formation of diabetic retinopathy.
E-selectin	diabetic retinopathy	An elevated E-selectin level can play a role in the development of diabetic retinopathy, but it does not seem to alter disease severity.
E-selectin	diabetic retinopathy	However, glycemic control and the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors may also alter the level of E-selectin that might play a role in the prevention of diabetic retinopathy.
E-selectin	retinal detachment	To evaluate efficacy of the treatment, the progression of the disease (number of laser treatments, number of bevacizumab treatments, and incidence of retinal detachment) was evaluated by serial ophthalmologic examinations, and plasma soluble E-selectin levels were measured weekly.
E-selectin	macular edema	After adjusting for age, glycemic control, and other potential confounders, baseline plasma levels of E-selectin were associated significantly with progression of DR, E-selectin and tumor necrosis factor-Alfa (TNF-Alfa) levels with incidence of proliferative DR (PDR), and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and TNF-Alfa levels with incidence of macular edema (ME).
GluRs	epilepsy	The 6-HT was administrated by perfusion and ejection in "brain slices" of hippocampus, inducing epileptic activity after its administration; the toxin was not able to block the epileptogenic crisis observed in the chronic model of the epilepsy, suggesting that 6-HT did not block the overactive GluRs responsible for this epileptic activity.
ECE1	systemic sclerosis	In patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), the relationship between innate immune activation, represented by increased expression of interferon (IFN)-regulated genes, and vascular injury/activation, manifest by increased endothelin-1 (ET-1), endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, is uncertain.
SR-BI	prostate cancer	Recent findings indicate that the level of SR-BI expression correlate with aggressiveness and poor survival in breast and prostate cancer.
SR-BI	prostate cancer	Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemistry analysis on human primary prostate cancer tissue sections derived from patients to investigate the correlation of SR-BI with clinicopathological parameters and the mTOR target pS6.
SR-BI	prostate cancer	In contrast to LDLR, we identified SR-BI mRNA and protein expression to be induced in high Gleason grade primary prostate cancers.
SR-BI	prostate cancer	We identified SR-BI to indicate human prostate cancer formation, suggesting that increased levels of SR-BI may be involved in the generation of a castration-resistant phenotype.
SR-BI	prostate cancer	Silencing of SR-BI may impact the ability of prostate cancer cells, particularly those of castration-resistant state, to maintain the intracellular supply of androgens by removing a supply of cholesterol.
SR-BI	prostate cancer	The down-regulation of SR-BI significantly impacts PSA production of prostate cancer cells, as well as the viability of C4-2 cells in the presence and absence of HDL.
SR-BI	prostate cancer	This may indicate a deficiency in cholesterol availability to the androgen synthesis pathway or may implicate a role for SR-BI in prostate cancer signal transduction pathways.
pPROM	bacterial vaginosis	play roles in preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM); 3) integrated aspects of maternal and fetal host responses (inflammation, altered immune adaptations, endocrine and paracrine mechanisms) play increasingly understood roles in premature activation of parturition; and 4) identification and systemic treatment of common genitourinary infections, most importantly bacterial vaginosis (BV), reduce the risks of preterm delivery and PROM.
PPROM	bacterial vaginosis	Univariate analysis showed the following to be significant predictors of PPROM at &lt; 35 weeks: a past history of PTD between 25 and 30 weeks (P &lt; 0.008), cerclage in the current pregnancy (P &lt; 0.0001), bacterial vaginosis (P &lt; 0.011), CL &lt; 25 mm (P &lt; 0.0001) and CF &gt; 25% (P &lt; 0.0001).

DENND1A	PCOS	Despite the impediments posed by phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity among women with PCOS, investigation into one locus, the DENND1A gene, is providing insight into the ovarian steroidogenesis.
DENND1A	PCOS	We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the rs10818854, rs2479106, and rs10986105 polymorphism in DENND1A gene with PCOS susceptibility.
DENND1A	PCOS	In conclusion, the DENND1A gene variant is likely to have influence on PCOS risk.
DENND1A	PCOS	PCOS has a strong genetic component, and genome-wide association studies have identified several candidate genes, notably DENND1A, which encodes connecdenn 1, involved in trafficking of endosomes.
DENND1A	PCOS	Furthermore, overexpression of DENND1A variant 2 in normal theca cells resulted in a PCOS phenotype with increased androgen production.
DENND1A	PCOS	In addition, GWAS have suggested that DENND1A, epidermal growth factor signaling, and DNA repair pathways play a role in PCOS pathogenesis.
DENND1A	polycystic ovary	The rs2479106 and rs10818854 polymorphisms in the DENND1A gene have been reported to be extensively associated with risk of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
DENND1A	PCOS	Overall, significant increase of PCOS risk was found between DENND1A-rs10818854 and PCOS susceptibility.
DENND1A	PCOS	This meta-analysis suggested that rs2479106 and rs10818854 polymorphisms in the DENND1A gene were associated with increased risk of PCOS.
DENND1A	PCOS	Variant 2 of the DENND1A gene was found overexpressed in PCOS theca cells and confirmed to enhance androgen production.
DENND1A	PCOS	Our previous research had identified three susceptibility loci (rs2479106, DENND1A; rs13405728, LHCGR; rs13429458, THADA) for PCOS in Han Chinese women.

MGEA6	meningioma	Here, we show that antibodies against recombinantly expressed MGEA6/11 are found in 41.7% (10/24) of the sera from meningioma patients and in 2/8 sera of glioblastoma patients, whereas no response was seen in 12 sera from healthy persons.
MGEA6	meningioma	The immune response to MGEA6/11 is frequent in both meningioma and glioma patients and may likely be attributed to overexpression of the MGEA6/11 protein in the tumor cells.
meningioma expressed antigen-6	meningioma	The meningioma expressed antigen-6 (MGEA6) was originally identified as an immunogenic antigen in meningioma patients.
MGEA	meningioma	The clones were sequenced, and sequence comparison revealed that the seven clones represent five different genes, providing evidence that meningiomas express a spectrum of immunoreactive antigens, which were termed meningioma expressed antigens (MGEAs).
MGEA	meningioma	These data suggest that the newly identified MGEA genes may be useful for diagnosis and possibly therapy of meningioma.
meningioma expressed antigen 6	meningioma	The longest open reading frame was found to be 2412 bp encoding an immunoreactive antigen termed meningioma expressed antigen 6 (MEA6).

complement-C3	endocarditis	In case of coronary atherosclerosis the organism reaction to expressed CMC is manifested basically by intensified synthesis of cathodic complement-C3-similar autoprecipitin, but in case of endocarditis--by consumption of one with formation of anodic autoprecipitin and by intensified synthesis of autoprecipitating immunoglobulin G. These membranotropic autoimmune reactions are identical with the organism reactions to alien (heterologous) agents and differentially participate in development both of basic disease and perioperational complications after cardiac operations using trans- and implants, hence, they should be taken into account during membrane-stabilising and immunocorrecting therapy of recipients.

INCA 1	obesity	Our objectives were (i) to assess the current prevalence of childhood overweight (including obesity) (OWOB) in France and its relationship with comprehensive socioeconomic status (SES) indicators and (ii) to examine trends in OWOB prevalence and changes in energy intake (EI) and sedentary behavior (SED) based on the previous INCA 1 (Individuelle Nationale des Consommations Alimentaires) data (1998-1999).
protein in CA1	ischemia	Both estradiol and global ischemia markedly increased ERalpha, but not ERbeta, protein in CA1.
BMPR2	chondrosarcoma	It has been reported that BMPR2 is associated with chondrosarcoma.
BMPR2	chondrosarcoma	Moreover, the detection of BMPR2 is more frequent in dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas (DDCS) than in conventional chondrosarcomas (CCS).
BMPR2	chondrosarcoma	BMPR2, phospho-SMAD1/5 (pSMAD1/5), and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expressions were found to be associated with the pathological grades of chondrosarcoma and could be a promising target of treatment outcome.
BMPR2	chondrosarcoma	It has been demonstrated that more prevalent expression of bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) has been detected in dedifferentiated chondrosarcomas than conventional chondrosarcomas.
BMPR2	chondrosarcoma	Here, we find that BMPR2 inhibition induces apoptosis and autophagy of chondrosarcoma.
BMPR2	chondrosarcoma	We found that BMPR2 expression was correlated with the clinicopathological features of chondrosarcomas, and could predict the treatment outcome.
BMPR2	chondrosarcoma	Knockdown of BMPR2 by small interfering RNA results in growth inhibition in chondrosarcoma cells.
BMPR2	chondrosarcoma	Silencing BMPR2 promoted G2/M cell cycle arrest, induced chondrosarcoma cell apoptosis through caspase-3-dependent pathway via repression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) and induced autophagy of chondrosarcoma cells via XIAP-Mdm2-p53 pathway.
BMPR2	chondrosarcoma	Inhibition of autophagy induced by BMPR2 small interfering RNA (siBMPR2) sensitized chondrosarcoma cells to siBMPR2-induced apoptotic cell death, suggesting that autophagy has a protective role for chondrosarcoma cells in context of siBMPR2-induced apoptotic cell death.
BMPR2	chondrosarcoma	Taken together, our results suggest that BMPR2 has a significant role in the tumorigenesis of chondrosarcoma, and could be an important prognostic marker for chondrosarcoma.
BMPR2	chondrosarcoma	BMPR2 inhibition could eventually provide a promising therapy for chondrosarcoma treatment.
Beta-defensin-1	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	The role of Beta-defensin-1 in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains unclear.

5-HT4	motion sickness	Moreover, it is suggested that blockades of 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors are not relevant to the control of motion sickness; and furthermore, it suggested that blocking 5-HT4 receptors in addition to 5-HT3 receptors does not have an additional effect on the control of cisplatin-induced emesis, but that 5-HT4 receptors are at least partly involved in the mechanism of emesis induced by copper sulfate.
GN2	diarrhea	Therefore, we used Biolog GN2 microplates to analyze the ability of 103 clinical, predominantly diarrheal, isolates of Aeromonas to use various carbon sources, and we verified whether, among the substrates metabolized by these strains, there were some endogenous to the human intestine.
GN2	RP30	RP30 was one of these strains that was randomly selected and analysed by using a morphological, physiological and biochemical plate, Biolog GN2 Microplate System and API 20E system.
GN 2	proteinuria	Histological and clinical diagnoses of the 14 patients were as follows: IgA nephropathy 3, non-IgA GN 2, and asymptomatic significant microscopic hematuria [more than 100 red blood cells per high-power field (x400)] with or without proteinuria 9.
GN-2	glomerulonephritis	The incidence of membranous form of glomerulonephritis was high (34 out of 44 kidney biopsy cases, 77%), the rest of patients showing mesangiocapillary GN-8 (18%) and mesangial proliferative GN-2 (5%).
GN-2	nephrosis	In organ cultures, nephrosis-producing IBV strains (GN-2 and M-41) were slightly more ciliostatic and respiratory strains (Beaudette and Kita-1/Tokushima) less ciliostatic at 40.5 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. Mortality of chicken embryos infected with the GN-2, M-41 and Kita-1/Tokushima strains was greater at 40.5 degrees C than at 37 degrees C, while the reverse was true of the Beaudette strain which caused no embryo mortality at 40.5 degrees C. The Beaudette strain of IBV was the only one which could not be recovered from the kidneys of young chickens four days after infection.
GN2	Alzheimer's disease	In addition, in Alzheimer's disease we found simple gangliosides (GN2, GM3) to be elevated in the frontal and parietal cortex, which might correlate accelerated lysosomal degradation of gangliosides and/or astrogliosis occurring during neuronal death.
cathepsin-G	cutaneous mastocytosis	The aim of this study was to investigate the immunoreactivity to tryptase and to cathepsin-G of MC from human cutaneous mastocytosis and to compare their number in normal skin and cutaneous mastocytosis.
cathepsin-G	cutaneous mastocytosis	Morphometric evaluation of MC number demostrated that the number of both tryptase- and cathepsin-G-positive MC was significantly higher in cutaneous mastocytosis as compared to normal skin and that in both conditions the number of tryptase-positive MC was significantly higher as compared to the number of cathepsin-G-positive MC.

miR-126-5p	cancer	In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-126-5p and Bcl2l2 in cervical cancer cells.
miR-126-5p	cancer	First, miR-126-5p expression was aberrantly downregulated in human cervical cancer tumor tissues in comparison with normal tissues, as evaluated by RT-PCR.
miR-126-5p	cancer	Consistently, the levels of miR-126-5p were also significantly reduced in cervical cancer cell lines when compared to normal cervical epithelial cells.
miR-126-5p	cancer	Flow cytometric analysis showed that the rate of apoptosis of cervical cancer cells was significantly increased by miR-126-5p overexpression but inhibited by miR-126-5p inhibitor.
miR-126-5p	cancer	A similar change pattern was observed in the expression of apoptosis-regulated protein caspase 3 in cervical cancer cells transfected with miR-126-5p mimic or inhibitor.
miR-126-5p	cancer	By bioinformatic prediction with online databases and verification using luciferase reporter assay, we then identified that Bcl2l2 is a direct target of miR-126-5p in cervical cancer cells.
miR-126-5p	cancer	The expression of Bcl2l2 was strongly downregulated by the miR-126-5p mimic but upregulated by the miR-126-5p inhibitor in cervical cancer cells, and Bcl2l2 expression was significantly increased in human cervical cancer tumor tissues, which was negatively correlated with miR-126-5p levels.
miR-126-5p	cancer	Furthermore, we confirmed that the rate of apoptosis was significantly increased by Bcl2l2 silencing in cervical cancer cells, which was not affected by the miR-126-5p inhibitor.
miR-126-5p	cancer	In summary, miR-126-5p plays an inhibitory role in human cervical cancer progression, regulating the apoptosis of cancer cells via directly targeting Bcl2l2.
miR-126*	myelodysplastic syndrome	Patients with miR-126*low myelodysplastic syndrome had significantly lower response rates (P = 0.04) and higher relapse rates (P = 0.03), as well as shorter progression-free (PFS; P = 0.004) and overall survival (OS; P = 0.004).
miR-126-5p	acute myeloid leukemia	In the present study, the relationship between miR-126-5p/3p expression levels and overall survival in 109 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who received intensive therapy were evaluated.
MEF2D	Burkitt's lymphoma	The presence of XBP-1s, the active form of XBP-1, after administration of anti-Ig to Akata Burkitt's lymphoma cells is consistent with a role for this factor in reactivation of the EBV lytic cycle, although signalling through MEF2D was quantitatively much more significant in activation of Zp.
myocyte enhancer factor-2D	B-cell lymphoma	As expected, markers of neuronal differentiation such as anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), myocyte enhancer factor-2D (MEF2D) and zipper protein kinase (MAP3K12; aka ZPK/MUK/DLK) were each up-regulated in response to differentiation.
Shc	carcinoma	The decrease in T-Shc and T1 were less obvious in mucinous adenocarcinoma and not observed in serous or endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
Shc	melanoma	Overexpression of the signalling adaptor protein ShcD in melanoma was found to be a prerequisite for melanoma migration and invasion.
Shc	melanoma	We have further demonstrated that ShcD accumulates in the nucleus upon hydrogen peroxide treatment in FLAG-ShcD expressing HEK293 cells, as well as 518.A2 melanoma cells.
Shc	melanoma	We suggest that ShcD nuclear translocation might provide melanoma cells with a mechanism that enables them to resist DNA damage due to oxidative stress.
Shc	melanoma	Rai like protein (RaLP) is a newly identified Src homology 2 domain containing (Shc) family member selectively expressed during the transition to metastatic melanoma and thus is a potential melanoma-specific drugable target.

ACKR1	neutropenia	The absence of erythroid ACKR1 altered mouse hematopoiesis including stem and progenitor cells, which ultimately gave rise to phenotypically distinct neutrophils that readily left the circulation, causing neutropenia.
DARC	ocular hypertension	In vivo studies in Adult Dark Agouti (DA) rats with unilateral surgically-induced ocular hypertension (OHT) treated with either CoQ10/TPGS micelles or TPGS vehicle twice daily for three weeks were performed, following which retinal cell health was assessed in vivo using DARC (Detection of Apoptotic Retinal Cells) and post-mortem with Brn3a histological assessment on whole retinal mounts.
DARC	neutropenia	After correction for multiple testing, DARC polymorphism rs3027012 in 5'-UTR was associated with higher risk of low absolute phagocyte count (APC&lt;500 and &lt;1000 cells per microliter, P=0.001 and P&lt;0.0005, respectively) and hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia (P=0.002).

PHD and RING finger domains 1	cancer	In addition, knockdown of epigenetic regulator UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING finger domains 1) in RIP3-null cancer cells reduces the methylation level of the Rip3 promoter.
PHD and RING finger domains 1	medulloblastoma	A previous study revealed that ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1 (UHRF1) promoted cell proliferation and was a potential biomarker in medulloblastoma (MB).
PHD and ring finger domains 1	cancer	Three lncRNAs, sex determining region Y-box 2 overlapping transcript (SOX2-OT), NCBP2 antisense RNA 2 (NCBP2-AS2) and ubiquitin like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1), were predicted to be associated with lung cancer; RT-qPCR confirmed that SOX2-OT and NCBP2-AS2 were associated with lung cancer.
PHD and RING finger domains 1	cancer	UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like, with PHD and RING finger domains 1) plays a crucial role in DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling and gene expression and is aberrantly upregulated in various types of human cancers.
PHD and RING finger domains 1	cancer	UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like with PHD and RING finger domains 1) is a critical regulator for DNA methylation, and its frequent overexpression in human cancers has been associated with tumor-promoting effects.
PHRF1	cancer	The lower level of PHRF1 mRNA was observed in human lung cancer tissues than that in paracancerous tissues.
PHRF1	cancer	In conclusion, our findings suggest that overexpression of PHRF1 attenuated the proliferation and tumorigenicity of non-small cell lung cancer cell line of H1299.
CDC6	microcephaly	Recessive mutations in ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1 or CDC6 of the preRC in human cause Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS) that is characterized by impaired post-natal growth, short stature and microcephaly.
CDC6	microcephaly	Mutations in ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, and CDC6, which encode proteins required for DNA replication origin licensing, cause Meier-Gorlin syndrome (MGS), a disorder conferring microcephaly, primordial dwarfism, underdeveloped ears, and skeletal abnormalities.

HMGB1	allergic rhinitis	Previous studies have shown that HMGB1 is elevated in the nasal lavage fluids (NLF) of children suffering from allergic rhinitis (AR) and is associated with the severity of this disease.
SHPK	cystinosis	The major cystinosis mutation is a 57 kb deletion on human chromosome 17p13 that removes the majority of CTNS and the entire adjacent gene, CARKL/SHPK.
CARKL	cystinosis	The most common mutation in the nephropathic cystinosis (CTNS) gene is a homozygous 57-kb deletion that also includes an adjacent gene carbohydrate kinase-like (CARKL).
CARKL	cystinosis	Analysis of the resulting data revealed a number of interesting features about this genomic region, including the long-range organization of CTNS, insight about the breakpoints and intervening DNA associated with the common cystinosis-causing deletion, and structural information about five genes neighboring CTNS (human ortholog of rat vanilloid receptor subtype 1 gene, CARKL, TIP-1, P2X5, and HUMINAE).
CARKL	cystinosis	In particular, sequence analysis detected the presence of a novel gene (CARKL) residing within the most common cystinosis-causing deletion.
CARKL	cystinosis	Interestingly, both CTNS and CARKL are absent in nearly half of all cystinosis patients (i.e., those homozygous for the common deletion).

CDH13	chronic myeloid leukemia	To investigate the expression of the CDH13 gene and BCR/ABL fusion gene in chronic myeloid leukemia(CML) patients at different stages and explore their relationship.
CDH13	acute myeloid leukemia	We performed genomewide screening for methylated CpG islands and identified 8 genes frequently methylated in leukemia cell lines and in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML): NOR1, CDH13, p15, NPM2, OLIG2, PGR, HIN1, and SLC26A4.
CDH13	chronic myeloid leukemia	Although defective progenitor-stromal adhesion is a well-recognized feature of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the role of CDH13 abnormalities has not been evaluated in this disease.

SERCA3	choroid plexus carcinoma	In this work we investigated the expression of the SERCA3-type calcium pump in choroid plexus epithelial cells grown in vitro, and in normal and hyperplastic choroid plexus tissue, in choroid plexus papillomas displaying various degrees of atypia, and in choroid plexus carcinoma by immunohistochemistry in situ.
SERCA3	choroid plexus carcinoma	Whereas normal choroid plexus epithelial cells express SERCA3 abundantly, SERCA3 expression is strongly decreased in papillomas, and is absent in choroid plexus carcinoma, while expression in hyperplastic epithelium is high, similarly to normal epithelium.
RhoA	GBM	Due to the inverse interaction of Rac1 and Ras homolog family member A (RhoA) signaling in the transition between mesenchymal and amoeboid morphology, simultaneous treatment of NSC23766 and Y27632 (selective Rho associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 inhibitor), abolished U87 GBM cell migration through inhibiting MAT and amoeboid-mesenchymal transition.
RhoA	GBM	The combined inhibition of Rac1 and RhoA signaling would be a promising strategy to suppress GBM invasion.
RhoA	lupus nephritis	Specifically, combination therapy inhibited TLR7 expression in the kidneys of mice with lupus nephritis; combination of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil led to better stabilization of the podocyte actin cytoskeleton through the reciprocal regulation of RhoA and Rac1 activities.
GNA11	primary hyperparathyroidism	We hypothesized that mutations in AP2S1 and GNA11 are causative in Danish patients with suspected FHH and that these mutations are not found in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), which is the main differential diagnostic disorder.
GNA11	primary hyperparathyroidism	Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is a genetically heterogeneous condition resembling primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) but not curable by surgery; FHH types 1, 2, and 3 are due to loss-of-function mutations of the CASR, GNA11, or AP2S1 genes, respectively.
GNA11	primary hyperparathyroidism	The aim of this study was to analyse prevalence and pathogenicity of CaSR, GNA11 and AP2S1 mutations in patients with an FHH phenotype and to compare them with a sample of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in order to identify the most useful laboratory parameter for a differential diagnosis.
B-box	cancer	Tripartite motif-containing protein 37 (TRIM37), a new member of the RING-B-box-coiled-coil (RBCC) subfamily of zinc finger proteins, was found to be involved in the development and progression of several cancers.
B box	cancer	In the present work, we clearly demonstrate that HMGB1 secreted by cancer cells is N-glycosylated at Asn37, which facilitates monocytic (M)-MDSC differentiation from bone marrow via the p38/NFKB/Erk1/2 pathway and also contributes to conversion of monocytes into MDSC-like cells; HMGB1 blockade by a monoclonal antibody against the HMGB1 B box obviously reduced the accumulation of M-MDSC in tumor-bearing mice, delaying tumor growth and development; additionally, MDSC expansion and HMGB1 up-regulation were also found in breast cancer patients.
COMT	conversion disorder	We examined a possible association between the COMT Val158Met polymorphism and conversion disorder in a study of 48 patients with conversion disorder and 48 control patients.

DR4	optic neuritis	The frequency of HLA-DR4 was increased in patients with optic neuritis alone compared to controls and to patients with multiple sclerosis, but further studies are required to confirm this finding.
B4GALNT3	cancer	The MS profiling by PGC-LC also revealed several glycan structural isomers that corresponded to LacdiNAc-type (GalNAcBeta1-4GlcNAc) motifs that were unique to the serous ovarian cancers and that correlated with elevated gene expression of B4GALNT3 and B4GALNT4 in patients with serous cancer.
B4GALNT3	cancer	We previously showed that B4GALNT3 overexpression enhances colon cancer cell malignant phenotypes in vitro and in vivo.
B4GALNT3	cancer	However, the role of B4GALNT3 in cancer stemness remains unclear.
B4GALNT3	colorectal cancer	We found that B4GALNT3 expression was positively correlated with advanced stages and poor survival in colorectal cancer patients.
B4GALNT3	cancer	Knockdown of B4GALNT3 using small interfering (si) RNAs in colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, SW480, HCT15, and HT29 cells) decreased sphere formation and the expression of stem cell markers, OCT4 and NANOG.
B4GALNT3	cancer	Taken together, these data suggest B4GALNT3 regulates cancer stemness and the invasive properties of colon cancer cells through modifying EGFR glycosylation and signaling.
B4GALNT3	neuroblastoma	In this study, we investigated the expression and role of B4GALNT3 in human neuroblastoma (NB).
IL-7	cataract	Detection rates were as follows: IL-7: NVG higher than POAG; IL-10: POAG lower than cataract or NVG; and GM-CSF: cataract higher than POAG or NVG.
IL-7	RVO	Sixty-four vitreous samples (40 RVO, 24 controls with idiopathic floaters) were analyzed in this retrospective case series using LC/MS for LPAs 16:0, 18:0, 18:1, 20:4, and ELISA kits or Luminex technology for ATX, angiopoetin-1 (ANG-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-7 (IL-7), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

TLR2	AIDS	Diagnosis of AIDS-NHL was preceded by a significantly elevated frequency of activated/germinal center-like CD19CD10CD71CD86AID B cells (P = 0.0072), elevated serum prevalence of the TLR2 ligand, and significantly elevated B-cell TLR2 expression (P = 0.0015), positively correlating with the frequency of activated/germinal center-like B cells (rho = 0.7273, P = 0.0144).
TLR2	AIDS	TLR2-stimulated purified B cells exhibited the activated B-cell phenotype observed in HIV+ subjects before AIDS-NHL diagnosis.
TLR2	AIDS	These results indicate that an elevated fraction of B cells display an activated/germinal center phenotype in those HIV+ subjects who go on to develop AIDS-NHL and suggest that TLR2-mediated activation may play a role in HIV infection-associated B-cell activation, potentially contributing to the genesis of AIDS-NHL.
AVP	post-traumatic stress disorder	The regulatory role of AVP on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suggests potential uses for AVP receptor modulators in various CNS indications, including depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.

beta-thalassemia major	thrombocytosis	This study included 54 beta-thalassemia major patients divided into 2 groups; group A consisted of 28 patients who have thrombocytosis secondary to a previous splenectomy and group B comprised of 26 patients who did not have a splenectomy with normal platelet count, as well as a control group of 30 healthy individuals.
claudin-10	lung adenocarcinoma	A microarray analysis of the B-1 lymphocytes revealed that IL-10 deficiency is associated with down-regulation of the genes that code for claudin-10, a protein that is involved in cell-to-cell contact and that has been linked to lung adenocarcinoma.
claudin-10	melanoma	Thus, our findings suggest that the axis IL-10/claudin-10 is a promising target for the development of therapeutic agents against aggressive melanoma.
claudin-10	cancer	To explore the expression distinction of the cell adhesion proteins claudin-10,-14,-17 and E-cadherin in the adjacent non-neoplastic tissues and gastric cancer tissues, 50 gastric cancer tissues and 50 samples of adjacent non-neoplastic tissues adjacent to the tumors were examined for expression of claudin-10,-14,-17 and E-cadherin by streptavidin-perosidase immunohistochemical staining method.
claudin-10	cancer	The positive expression rates of claudin-10 in gastric cancer tissues and adjacent non-neoplastic tissues were 24% and 72% respectively (P &lt; 0.01).
claudin-10	cancer	In contrast, the positive expression rates of claudin-14 in gastric cancer tissues and adjacent non-neoplastic tissues were 58% and 24% respectively (P = 0.015 &lt; 0.05) Thus in our study, the expression of E-cadherin, claudin-10, and claudin-17 was down-regulated in gastric cancer tissue while the expression of claudin-14 was up-regulated.
claudin-10	cancer	Our study reveals that the expression of E-cadherin, claudin-10, and claudin-17 were down-regulated in gastric cancer tissue while the expression of claudin-14 was up-regulated and correlation between claudins and E-cadherin expression with lymphatic metastasis were observed.
claudin 10	lung adenocarcinoma	Four genes (MMP-2, c-fos, claudin 1 (CLDN1) and claudin 10(CLDN10)) were correlated with the results of microarray and real time RT-PCR analyses for the gene-expression data in samples from 41 patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
CLDN10	lung adenocarcinoma	Immunohistochemical staining for these genes in samples from 81 cases of lung adenocarcinoma demonstrated the expressions of CLDN1 and CLDN10 were correlated with overall survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
CLDN10	lung adenocarcinoma	Overexpression of CLDN1 and CLDN10 indicates a favorable prognosis for overall survival in some patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
Gnaz	diabetic retinopathy	Furthermore, circadian regulation of Gnaz was disturbed in the db/db mouse, a model of diabetic retinopathy.

DHFR	unilateral retinoblastoma	In a recent study we found that the risk for unilateral retinoblastoma in offspring is 4 fold higher in women that are homozygotes for the 19 bp deletion in the DHFR gene and took folic acid supplement during pregnancy.
dhfr	Retinoblastoma	Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) was highly phosphorylated but p107 was upregulated, and the expression of E2f target genes was dysregulated as shown by upregulation of Cdc6 but downregulation of cyclin E, dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr), Cdc25a and B-Myb in chondrocytes of K6(H)/D1(H) mice.
DHFR	retinoblastoma	The authors used a case-control study design to examine the association between retinoblastoma risk and maternal variations in the folate-metabolizing genes methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) (a cytosine-to-thymine substitution at nucleotide 677 [MTHFR677C-&gt;T]; reference single nucleotide polymorphism rs1801133) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (a 19-base-pair deletion of intron 1a [DHFR19bpdel]; rs70991108).
DHFR	unilateral retinoblastoma	The risk of having a child with unilateral retinoblastoma was associated with maternal homozygosity for DHFR19bpdel (odds ratio, 3.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.89-7.55; P = .0002), even after controlling for the child's DHFR19bpdel genotype (odds ratio, 2.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-5.99; P = .0073).
DHFR	retinoblastoma	Maternal homozygosity for a polymorphism in the DHFR gene necessary for converting synthetic folic acid into biologic folate was associated with an increased risk for retinoblastoma.

GPB	cirrhosis	GPB dosed at 6 mL BID lowered fasting ammonia levels in cirrhotic patients with HE as compared with baseline, was better tolerated than 9 mL BID, and is appropriate for further evaluation in patients with cirrhosis and episodic HE.
GPB	cirrhosis	GPB reduced HE events as well as ammonia in patients with cirrhosis and HE and its safety profile was similar to placebo.
GPB	cirrhosis	In vitro and clinical studies have been performed to assess GPB digestion, safety, and pharmacology in healthy adults and individuals with cirrhosis.
GPB	cirrhosis	GPB exhibits delayed release characteristics, presumably reflecting gradual PBA release by pancreatic lipases, and is well tolerated in adults with cirrhosis, suggesting that further clinical testing for HE is warranted.
S1PR1	leukemia	However, the role of S1PR1 in the progression of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains to be fully elucidated.
S1PR1	leukemia	Using overexpression and RNA interference knockdown assays, it was shown that the expression of S1PR1 in several human myeloid leukemia cell lines contributed to the suppression of cell apoptosis and promotion of cell proliferation.
S1P1	chronic lymphocytic leukemia	Circulating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells display an abnormal increase in the surface levels of the homing receptors CCR7 and CXCR4 concomitant with low S1P receptor 1 (S1P1) expression.
keratin 17	cervical squamous cell carcinoma	Previous work in our laboratory identified keratin 17 (K17) as a specific and sensitive biomarker for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
keratin-17	cervical cancer	In this study, we show that high expression of keratin-17 (K17) predicts poor outcome in patients with cervical cancer, at early or late stages of disease, surpassing in accuracy either tumor staging or loss of p27(KIP1) as a negative prognostic marker in this setting.
KRT17	cervical cancer	In summary, both KRT4 and KRT17 expressions are related to the histopathology of the cervical squamous mucosa; KRT17 is highly overexpressed in immature squamous metaplasia, in HSIL, and in squamous cell carcinoma and the level of KRT17 in squamous cell carcinoma may help to identify patients who are at greatest risk for cervical cancer mortality.
P2X4	epilepsy	P2X4 receptors in microglia are up-regulated in epilepsy and in neuropathic pain; that is to say, their total and/or PM expression levels increase.
P2X4	status epilepticus	Expression of several members of the family including P2X2, P2X4, and P2X7 receptors has been reported to be altered in the hippocampus following status epilepticus.
P2X4	status epilepticus	Recent work also found altered neuronal injury and inflammation after status epilepticus in mice lacking the P2X4 receptor.
P2X4	status epilepticus	In this study, we investigated the potential involvement of P2X4R in microglial functions in a model of kainate (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE).
P2X4	epilepsy	Here we show that, in the seizure-sensitive (SS) gerbil hippocampus, a recognized genetic epilepsy model, the expressions of both P2X2 and P2X4 receptors are markedly decreased as compared with that in the seizure-resistant (SR) gerbil.

Inositol Polyphosphate-5-Phosphatase F	glioma	Here, we demonstrate that Inositol Polyphosphate-5-Phosphatase F (INPP5F), one of the polyphosphoinositide phosphatases, is differentially expressed in GSCs from glioma patients, and is identified as an inhibitor of STAT3 signaling via interaction with STAT3 and inhibition of its phosphorylation.
INPP5F	glioma	In addition, loss of INPP5F gene in gliomas is significantly correlated with lower overall patient survivals.
INPP5F	glioma	These findings suggest that INPP5F is a potential tumor suppressor in gliomas via inhibition of STAT3 pathway, and that deregulation of INPP5F may lead to contribution to gliomagenesis.
amd	retinitis pigmentosa	The patient and his identical twin show a retinal dystrophy that, based on clinical appearance, visual fields, amd electrophysiology, is most likely autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa.
occludin	fatty liver disease	Although Gln supplementation had no effect on the loss of the tight junction protein occludin, the increased portal endotoxin and fasting glucose concentrations found in WSD-fed mice, markers of liver damage (e.g., nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score and number of neutrophils in the liver) were significantly lower in the WSD+Gln group than in the WSD group (~47% and ~60% less, respectively; P &lt; 0.05).

TLR9	asthma	There were no significant associations between TLR3, TLR4, TLR8, or TLR9 polymorphisms and post-bronchiolitis asthma.
TLR9	asthma	Significant associations with SAFS compared with atopic asthma included Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) (p = .009), TLR9 (p = .025), C-type lectin domain family seven member A (dectin-1) (p = .043), interleukin-10 (IL-10) (p = .0010), mannose-binding lectin (MBL2) (p = .007), CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) (2 SNPs, p = .025 and .041), CCL17 (p = .002), plasminogen (p = .049) and adenosine A2a receptor (p = .024).
TLR-9	Asthma	Asthmatics had significantly lower circulating HPC expressing TLR-2 and TLR-9 with a similar trend for TLR-4.
TLR9	asthma	The endosomal TLRs have been shown to be associated with the induction of asthmatic inflammation (TLR3), and with disease exacerbations (TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9).

TNFR1	schizophrenia	Serum sTNFR1 was significantly higher in patients with acute-stage schizophrenia compared to matched controls while no significant group differences were observed for the other markers.
tumor necrosis factor receptor 1	schizophrenia	Plasma levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNF-R1), interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), osteoprotegerin (OPG), and von Willebrand factor (vWf) were measured in patients (n=992) with schizophrenia spectrum (SCZ, n=584), schizoaffective disorder (SA, n=93), affective spectrum disorders (AFF, n=315), and healthy controls (HC, n=638).
serum albumin	muscle wasting	MIS includes 10 components: dry weight changes, dietary intake, functional capacity, comorbidity, muscle wasting and loss of subcutaneous fat as well as body mass index (BMI), serum albumin level and total iron binding capacity (TIBC).
albumin	muscle wasting	This study suggests that consecutive PNC contributed to the improvement of the protein intake, serum levels of albumin, cholesterol and to the delay of muscle wasting, which could also have a positive impact on the nutritional status, particularly in malnourished patients receiving HD treatment.

albumin	arthritis	Results In vivo SPECT/CT imaging of the new folate conjugate (cm09) was as useful as a folate conjugate without albumin-binding entity in the groove model of osteoarthritis with less renal accumulation.
4-1BB	psoriasis	However, the effects of agonistic anti-4-1BB Abs have not been examined in an experimental mouse model of psoriasis.
4-1BB	psoriasis	Therefore, we investigated the protective effects of agonistic anti-4-1BB Abs, using imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis in mice, a condition histologically and clinically similar to human psoriasis.
4-1BB	psoriasis	We found that administration of agonistic anti-4-1BB Abs (10mg/kg) significantly alleviated the severity of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice, with reduced histologic symptoms, including inflammatory infiltration, parakeratosis, and hyperkeratosis.
4-1BB	psoriasis	Taken together, our data provide evidence that agonistic anti-4-1BB Abs possesses immunosuppressive properties in IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation, providing insight into the immunomodulatory effect of agonistic anti-4-1BB Abs for psoriasis immunotherapy.
TNFRSF9	psoriasis	Among identified psoriasis risk variants, three were more strongly associated with PsC than PsA (rs12189871 near HLA-C, p = 5.0 x 10(-19); rs4908742 near TNFRSF9, p = 0.00020; rs10888503 near LCE3A, p = 0.0014), and two were more strongly associated with PsA than PsC (rs12044149 near IL23R, p = 0.00018; rs9321623 near TNFAIP3, p = 0.00022).

CD137	atopic dermatitis	Blood and tissue eosinophils from patients with IgE-mediated allergic responses (atopic dermatitis, extrinsic asthma) express CD137.
TUBA1B	uveal melanoma	Proteomic analysis revealed 14 statistically significant differentially expressed proteins, with nine showing increased expression (PDIA3, VIM/HEXA, SELENBP1, ENO1, CAPZA1, ERP29, TPI1, PARK7, and FABP3) and five showing decreased expression (EIF2S, PSMA3, RPSA, TUBB, and TUBA1B) in uveal melanomas that subsequently metastasized compared with those that did not.
K-ALPHA1	cancer	Among these, 14 genes (FTL, K-ALPHA1, LDHA, RPL4, ENO1, ANXA2, RPL9, RPL10, RPL13A, GNB2L1, AMBP, GC, A1BG, and SERPINC1), in addition to previously well-known liver cancer related genes, were confirmed to be differentially expressed in seven liver cancer cell lines and 17 HCC tissues by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.
K-ALPHA-1	cancer	Expression profiles of the 9 genes ACTB, ALAS1, G6PD, GAPD, HMBS, HPRT1, K-ALPHA-1, SDHA and TBP were established in matched malignant and nonmalignant tissue specimens from 14 patients with bladder cancer.
K-ALPHA-1	cancer	The use of HPRT1 alone as a reference gene shown in our study was sufficient, but the normalization factors generated from two (HRPT1, ALAS1) or all three genes (HRPT1, ALAS1, K-ALPHA-1) should be considered for an improved reliability of normalization in gene profiling studies of prostate cancer.
albumin	marasmus	We show that glucose clearance rates are affected in both children with marasmus as well as kwashiorkor, which correlate with plasma albumin concentrations.
albumin	marasmus	Although marasmus is characterized by clinical wasting, kwashiorkor is associated with peripheral edema, oxidative stress, hypoalbuminemia, and hypoglycemia.
albumin	marasmus	Total proteins, albumin and transferrin were all significantly lower in children with edema than in those with marasmus.
sPLA2	myonecrosis	In this condition, 8CR inhibited edema and myonecrosis induced by the sPLA2 activity of Crotalus durissus terrificus in a dose-dependent manner by decreasing interleukin-1Beta (IL-1Beta), tumor necrosis factor Alfa (TNF-Alfa), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and lipid peroxidation.
sPLA2	myonecrosis	In addition, it was shown that Crotalus durissus terrificus sPLA2 increases cell oxidative stress during edema and myonecrosis, and the antioxidant properties of the polyphenolic compound may be significant in mitigating the pharmacological effect induced by sPLA2 and other snake venom toxins.
sPLA2	myonecrosis	Moreover, 5CQA significantly decreased the enzymatic activity and the oedema and myonecrosis induced by native sPLA2.
sPLA2	myonecrosis	This flavonoid was able to decrease enzymatic activity and some pharmacological effects, such as myonecrosis, platelet aggregation, and neurotoxic activity caused by sPLA2, however, the inflammatory effect was not affected by naringin.
sPLA2	myonecrosis	Under the conditions tested, we observed that both Boc-5 and Boc-10 strongly decreased edema, myonecrosis, and neurotoxicity induced by native sPLA2.
sPLA2	pertussis	Incubation with pertussis toxin prior to the addition of either sPLA2 or LPA only showed abrogation of the response to LPA, thus suggesting the involvement of pertussis-sensitive Gi-proteins in the case of LPA.
CMNs	Wilms' tumor	In contrast, all of the four classical CMNs tested were negative, as were cases of Wilms' tumor and clear cell sarcoma of the kidney.
CMNs	Wilms' tumor	The aspirates were from 16 cases of classical Wilms' tumor (WT), one anaplastic WT, 2 clear cell sarcomas of the kidney (CCSK), 2 malignant rhabdoid tumors of the kidney (MRTK) and 6 congenital mesoblastic nephromas (CMNs).
CALP	dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans	Archival tissue from 38 patients with superficial smooth muscle cell and so-called fibrohistiocytic tumors (8 benign fibrous histiocytomas (BFHs), 6 dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFPT), 9 malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs), 9 leiomyomas (LMs) and 6 leiomyosarcomas (LMSs)) were immunostained with antibodies against SMA, HCD, CALP, PLAP and HPL.
CALP	synovial sarcoma	In cell culture, d12.CALP at low multiplicity of infection (0.001 plaque-forming unit/cell) selectively killed calponin-positive human synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma cells.
beta-defensin-1	HGE	To investigate the possible role of beta-defensins in gingival health and periodontal disease, we examined the effect of several stimuli on the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), human beta-defensin-1, -2, -3, and -4 (hBD) in primary human diseased gingival epithelial (HGE) cell cultures from periodontitis patients by quantitative TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
hBD-1	HGE	Human gingival epithelial cells (HGE) express two antimicrobial peptides of the beta-defensin family, human beta-defensin 1 (hBD-1) and hBD-2, as well as cytokines and chemokines that contribute to innate immunity.
Kcnj16	hypokalemia	SSKcnj16-/- rats exhibited hypokalemia and reduced blood pressure, and when fed a high-salt diet (4% NaCl), experienced 100% mortality within a few days triggered by salt wasting and severe hypokalemia.
Kir5.1	hypokalemia	Hence, patients with HNF1Beta mutations may have reduced Kir5.1 activity in the kidney, resulting in hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.
Kir5.1	metabolic acidosis	The Kir5.1(-/-) mice displayed hypokalemic, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with hypercalciuria.
Kcnj16	hypokalemia	In conclusion, disruption of Kcnj16 induces a severe renal phenotype that, apart from hypokalemia, is the opposite of the phenotype seen in SeSAME/EAST syndrome.
Kir5.1	metabolic acidosis	We found that Kir5.1(-/-) mice presented with persistent metabolic acidosis and a clear respiratory phenotype.
Kir5.1	metabolic acidosis	Despite metabolic acidosis, ventilation at rest and in hyperoxic hypercapnia were similar in wild-type and Kir5.1(-/-) mice.
Kir5.1	metabolic acidosis	We suggest that this compensatory modulation of the peripheral chemosensory inputs develops in Kir5.1(-/-) mice in order to counteract the effect of continuing metabolic acidosis on the activity of the peripheral chemoreceptors.
GSTO1	NSCLC	In this study, CYP2E1*5B, CYP2E1*6, CYP2E1*7B, GSTO1 (A140D), and TP53 (Arg72Pro) polymorphisms and response to platinum-based chemotherapy and survival in 137 advanced stage NSCLC patients were investigated.
GSTO1	transitional cell carcinoma	GSTO1-1 expression pattern has not been studied in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), as yet.
GSTO1	cancer	Increased GSTO1-1 expression might contribute to TCC development and/or progression supporting the notion that GSTO1-1 may be a promising novel cancer target.
GSTO1	cancer	Glutathione S-transferase omega 1 (GSTO1) is an atypical GST isoform that is overexpressed in several cancers and has been implicated in drug resistance.
GSTO1	cancer	Here we show that silencing of GSTO1 with siRNA significantly impairs cancer cell viability, validating GSTO1 as a potential new target in oncology.
GSTO1	cancer	These potent GSTO1 inhibitors suppress cancer cell growth, enhance the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin and inhibit tumour growth in colon cancer models as single agent.
GSTO1	colorectal cancer	Our findings demonstrate the therapeutic utility of GSTO1 inhibitors as anticancer agents and identify the novel cellular pathways under GSTO1 regulation in colorectal cancer.
angiogenin	pulmonary fibrosis	To explore the relationship between angiogenin-1/2 (Ang-1/2) and clinical parameters of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and to assess the value of Ang-1/2 in predicting the prognosis of patients with IPF.
ang	lung disorder	Preterm infants exposed to oxygen and mechanical ventilation are at risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a multifactorial chronic lung disorder characterized by arrested alveolar development and nonsprouting, dysmorphic microvascular angiogenesis.
EGR1	heart disease	Many genes previously known to be affected by BPA and involved in obesity, hypertension, or heart disease were altered following these treatments, and AP-1, EGR1, and EGFR were key hubs affected by BPA and/or overfeeding.
Egr-1	heart disease	Using immunohistochemistry, we studied Egr-1 expression specifically in a wide morphologic spectrum of pulmonary arteries in the lung tissue of 72 patients with different forms and stages of PAH, specifically idiopathic PAH (n = 18), advanced-stage congenital heart disease-associated PAH (PAH-CHD) (n = 21), early-stage PAH-CHD (n = 19) and non-neointimal hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (PH) (n = 4), and controls (n = 10).
PNUTL1	Parkinson's disease	Parkin substrates include two septins; SEPT4/CDCrel-2 which coaggregates with Alfa-synuclein as Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease, and its closest homolog SEPT5/CDCrel-1/PNUTL1 whose overload with viral vector can rapidly eliminate dopamine neurons in rats.

E2F4	colorectal cancer	Sequencing analysis of the endogenous E2F4 gene in a series of colorectal cancer cell lines showed that the microsatellite-unstable cell line SW48 exhibited a serine deletion in this gene.
E2F4	colorectal cancer	In conclusion, our data demonstrate that cancer-associated E2F4 mutations enhance the capacity of colorectal cancer cells to grow without anchorage, thereby contributing to tumor progression.
E2F4	colorectal cancer	The inverse immunohistochemical relationship between E2F1 and E2F4 indicates a possible mechanistic interlink in colorectal cancer.
E2F-4	colon cancer	In an attempt to identify the role of E2F-4 as a potential mediator of cell proliferation, differentiation, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis in colorectal mucosa comparing with that of E2F-1, the authors examine 20 patients with human colon cancer and their corresponding histologically healthy mucosa by using immunohistochemical methods, computerized quantitative image analysis, and immunoblot analysis.
E2F-4	colorectal cancer	Eighteen colorectal cancer (CRC) patients from 13 kindreds meeting the Amsterdam criteria for HNPCC were analyzed and compared to sporadic CRC patients with MSI-H. We detected mutations of E2F-4 at the same repeat sequence in HNPCC.
angiopoietin-2	capillary leak syndrome	Although the implication of vascular endothelial growth factor, angiopoietin-2, and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 has been suggested, the pathogenesis of systemic capillary leak syndrome remains unclear.
angiopoietin 2	capillary leak syndrome	Microvascular dysfunction under septic shock is related to: increased capillary permeability that manifests as a breakdown of the microvascular endothelial barrier (factors which may contribute to capillary leak syndrome include endogenous proinflammatory cytokines, angiopoietin 2, vascular endothelial growth factor); arteriolar hyporesponsiveness to vasoconstrictors and vasodilators, the loss of adrenergic sensitivity and tone of smooth muscle cells lining the arterioles; loss of the anti-adhesive function of endothelial surfaces; decreased density of perfused capillaries (due to several contributing factors: decreased deformability of erythrocytes and neutrophils; activation of the clotting cascade with fibrin deposition and the formation of microthrombi; dysfunction of vascular autoregulatory mechanisms by nitric oxide; enhanced functional arteriovenous shunting of the microcirculation).
AL-1	diabetes	Further investigations of AL-1 as a promising new agent for treatment and/or prevention of diabetes are warranted.
AL 1	amyloidosis	In established cardiac ATTR amyloidosis, T1 elevation was not as high as in AL amyloidosis (AL 1,130 +/- 68 ms; p = 0.01).
ephrinA5	hypoglycemia	We previously reported that EphA5 receptor-ephrinA5 interactions within the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) influence counterregulatory hormone responses during acute hypoglycemia in nondiabetic rats.
ephrinA5	hypoglycemia	In this study, we examined whether recurrent hypoglycemia alters the capacity of the ephrinA5 ligand to activate VMH EphA5 receptors, and if so, whether these changes could contribute to pathogenesis of defective glucose counterregulation in response to a standard hypoglycemic stimulus.
ephrinA5	hypoglycemia	The expression of ephrinA5, but not EphA5 receptors within the VMH, was reduced by antecedent recurrent hypoglycemia.
ephrinA5	hypoglycemia	Activation of VMH EphA5 receptors via targeted microinjection of ephrinA5-Fc before a hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic clamp study caused a reduction in the glucose infusion rate in nondiabetic rats exposed to recurrent hypoglycemia.
ephrinA5	hypoglycemia	These data suggest that changes in ephrinA5/EphA5 interactions and synaptic plasticity within the VMH, a key glucose-sensing region in the brain, may contribute to the impairment in glucagon secretion and counterregulatory responses caused by recurrent hypoglycemia.
ephrinA5	hypoglycemia	Activation of Beta-cell EphA5 receptors by its ligand ephrinA5 from adjacent Beta-cells has been reported to decrease insulin secretion during hypoglycemia.
ephrinA5	hypoglycemia	Given the similarities between islet and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) glucose sensing, we tested the hypothesis that the EphA5/ephrinA5 system might function within the VMH during hypoglycemia to stimulate counterregulatory hormone release as well.
ephrinA5	hypoglycemia	Local stimulation of VMH EphA5 receptors by ephrinA5-Fc or ephrinA5 overexpression increased, whereas knockdown of VMH ephrinA5 reduced counterregulatory responses during hypoglycemia.
ephrinA5	hypoglycemia	Overexpression of VMH ephrinA5 transiently increased local glutamate concentrations, whereas ephrinA5 knockdown produced profound suppression of VMH interstitial fluid glutamine concentrations in the basal state and during hypoglycemia.
ephrinA5	hypoglycemia	Changes in ephrinA5/EphA5 interactions within the VMH, a key brain glucose-sensing region, act in concert with islets to restore glucose homeostasis during acute hypoglycemia, and its effect on counterregulation may be mediated by changes in glutamate/glutamine cycling.
Al1	dcmA	Fractionation of dichloromethane (DCM) molecules with different chlorine isotopes by aerobic methylobacteria Methylobacterium dichloromethanicum DM4 and Albibacter nethylovorans DM10; cell-free extract of strain DM4; and transconjugant Methylobacterium evtorquens Al1/pME 8220, expressing the dcmA gene for DCM dehalogenase but unable to grow on DCM, was studied.
DVL2	PEComa	We also describe the first RCC with a DVL2-TFE3 gene fusion, in addition to an extrarenal pigmented PEComa with a NONO-TFE3 gene fusion.
DVL2	PEComa	Furthermore, among neoplasms with the SFPQ-TFE3, NONO-TFE3, DVL2-TFE3, and ASPL-TFE3 gene fusions, the RCCs are almost always PAX8 positive, cathepsin K negative by immunohistochemistry, whereas the mesenchymal counterparts (Xp11 translocation PEComas, melanotic Xp11 translocation renal cancers, and alveolar soft part sarcoma) are PAX8 negative, cathepsin K positive.
histone H4	colon carcinoma	The compound was further tested in vitro for acetylation of histone H4 and other non-histone proteins, and in vivo in a colon carcinoma model, showing significant proapoptotic and antitumor activities.
Histone H4	colon carcinoma	As a proof-of-principle, we have identified cytochrome C and Histone H4 as two of the predominant protein species in the 3D colon carcinoma cultures.
histone H4	gastric adenocarcinoma	Double 2-mm core tissue microarrays were made from 261 paraffin-embedded gastric adenocarcinoma samples and examined by immunohistochemistry for histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) acetylation and trimethylation, histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation, and histone H4 lysine 20 trimethylation.
NOR1	hepatocellular carcinoma	This study aimed to investigate the expression of NOR1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue and its relationship with prognosis.
NOR1	hepatocellular carcinoma	Oxidored-nitro domain-containing protein 1 (NOR1) expression levels are greater in hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma samples compared with from normal liver samples.
NOR1	liver cancer	In conclusion, these results indicate that NOR1 may be involved in the progression of HCC and thus may be a potential target for the treatment of liver cancer.
hOSCP1	liver carcinoma	To date, several studies have revealed that gene mutations of the transporters are likely to be associated with some diseases; however, there are no data concerning the genetic polymorphism of the hOSCP1 gene in Japanese patients with non-viral liver carcinoma (LC).
NOR1	hepatic cancer	The nitroreductase oxidored-nitro domain containing protein 1 (NOR1) gene may be involved in the chemical carcinogenesis of hepatic cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
NOR1	hepatocellular carcinoma	Using cDNA microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR, we previously discovered that NOR1 increases the expression of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) mRNA by 4.8-fold in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2.
NOR1	liver cancer	In addition, expression of human NOR1 protein in different normal and cancerous human tissues was analyzed via search of the human RNA and protein databases; the data showed that although most malignant cells weakly stained or were negative for NOR1 expression, the liver cancer cells displayed moderate to strong expression of NOR1.
NOR1	liver cancer	These data suggested that NOR1 might serve as a cancer/testis/brain antigen in cells, and that altered NOR1 expression in liver cancer may help us to elucidate the functions of NOR1 protein in liver carcinogenesis.
CFHR4	disease	Significant allelic associations with SLE were detected in European Americans (EA) and African Americans (AA), which could be attributed to an intronic CFH SNP (rs6677604, in intron 11, P(meta) = 6.6x10(-8), OR = 1.18) and an intergenic SNP between CFHR1 and CFHR4 (rs16840639, P(meta) = 2.9x10(-7), OR = 1.17) rather than to previously identified disease-associated CFH exonic SNPs, including I62V, Y402H, A474A, and D936E.
AWD	omphalocele	Gastroschisis and omphalocele are the most common fetal abdominal wall defects (AWDs).
AWD	omphalocele	AWDs were identified through gastroschisis and omphalocele checkboxes from publicly available US Natality data (2006 to 2010).
prokineticin1	colorectal cancer	The angiogenic proteins vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and prokineticin1 (PROK1) proteins are considered important in colorectal cancer, the relationship between their simultaneous expression and prognosis was investigated in the present study.
PROK1	colorectal cancer	VEGF and PROK1 expression in 620 primary human colorectal cancer lesions was confirmed via immunohistochemical staining with anti-VEGF and anti-PROK1 antibodies, and the correlation between the expression of these 2 proteins and recurrence/prognosis were investigated.
PROK1	colorectal cancer	The prognosis was poorer in colorectal cancers that expressed both PROK1 and VEGF relative to the cases that expressed only 1 protein, and the expression of both proteins was found to be an independent prognostic factor.
PROK1	colorectal cancer	Two angiogenic growth factors, in particular, Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Prokineticin1(PROK1), are considered to have an important role in hematogenous metastasis of colorectal cancer.
PROK1	colorectal cancer	Accordingly, we report our findings on the importance of the anti-tumor efffect by inhibiting these two factors in human colorectal cancer.When the culture fluid of Colorectal cancer cell lines(DLD-1, HCT116, and LoVo) with high levels of VEGF/PROK1 expression was injected subcutaneously into mice, the culture fluid increased subcutaneous angiogenesis.
PROK1	colorectal cancer	Also, tumor masses were produced in mice by subcutaneously embedding colorectal cancer cells with high levels VEGF/PROK1 expression.
PROK1	colorectal cancer	When both anti-PROK1 and anti-VEGF antibodies were simultaneously applied, tumor formation and peritumoral angiogenesis were strongly suppressed, compared with when either anti-PROK1 antibody or anti-VEGF antibody was applied alone.Simultaneous targeting of both angiogenic growth factors (VEGF/PROK1) may prove more useful in colorectal cancer.
PROK1	colorectal cancer	The current study established the anti-PROK1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and examined the relationship between the expression of PROK1 protein and human colorectal cancer.
PROK1	colorectal cancer	The expression of PROK1 protein was assessed in 620 resected sporadic colorectal cancer tissue samples by immunohistochemical staining with in-house-developed human PROK1 mAb to investigate the relationship of PROK1 expression to clinicopathologic factors, recurrence, and survival rate and to evaluate its prognostic significance.
PROK1	colorectal cancer	The expression of PROK1 protein was detected in 36 % (223/620) of human primary colorectal cancer lesions but no in the healthy mucosa adjacent to the colorectal cancer lesions.
PROK1	colorectal cancer	The expression of PROK1 protein was identified for the first time as a new prognostic factor in colorectal cancer.
PROK1	colorectal cancer	Here we investigated how the anti-PROK1 monoclonal antibody (mAb; established by our department) would affect the high-PROK1-expressing colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in vitro and vivo.
PROK1	colorectal cancer	PROK1 expression was not observed in healthy gastrointestinal mucosa, but was observed in the primary lesions in 23 out of 98 (31.6%) patients with colorectal cancer, 19 out of 55 (34.5%) patients with gastric cancer, and 5 of 10 (50%) patients with cancer of the small intestine.
Endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor	colon cancer	Endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF) has             recently been identified as one of the vascular endothelial growth factors, and             it is considered that the overexpression of EG-VEGF in colon cancer is related             to hepatic metastasis.
EG-VEGF	colon cancer	In this study, we report our recent novel findings of the             involvement of EG-VEGF in cell invasion of colon cancer cells.
EG-VEGF	colon cancer	Finally, the EG-VEGF receptor on the colon cancer cell membrane             was blocked by anti-PK-R1 and -PK-R2 antibodies to study whether cell invasion             ability would be altered.
EG-VEGF	colon cancer	In colon cancer cell lines where the expression of PK-R1             and 2 was confirmed, stimulation with EG-VEGF increased cell invasion a maximum             of ~3-5 times.
EG-VEGF	colon cancer	The study showed that the EG-VEGF             protein may act on MMP-2, -7 and -9 via PK-R2 to strengthen cell invasion ability             in colon cancer cell lines.
PK1	hepatocellular carcinoma	To study the implication of prokineticin 1 (PK1/EG-VEGF) and prokineticin 2 (PK2/Bv8) in hepatocellular carcinoma angiogenesis.
EG-VEGF	colorectal cancer	In this study, we investigated the expression of EG-VEGF in colorectal cancer, the relationship between its expression and clinicopathological factors, and the in vitro activity of EG-VEGF transfectants.
EG-VEGF	colorectal cancer	We determined expression levels of EG-VEGF in 113 advanced colorectal cancers resected in our hospital by quantitative PCR, and compared the expression levels and clinicopathological findings by multivariate analyses.
EG-VEGF	colorectal cancer	We speculate that, in colorectal cancers, the EG-VEGF gene functions as an important factor in angiogenesis in primary and metastatic lesions, and consider that it is useful as a novel prognostic factor.
endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor	hepatocellular carcinoma	The aim of the present study was to detect the correlation between the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietin 2 (Ang2), ephrinB2 and endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF) and carcinogenesis or portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) formation in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
PCDH11X	Alzheimer's disease	A recent genome-wide association study (GWA) reported a significant association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the PCDH11X gene and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).
Pcdh11X	Alzheimer's disease	Protocadherin 11X (Pcdh11X) has been suspected to be associated with Alzheimer's disease through participating in the metabolism of PP1Alfa and Beta-catenin or by altering the synaptic functions.
Pcdh11X	Alzheimer's disease	A recent genome-wide association study reported that a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs5984894) in the gene encoding Pcdh11X was associated with susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in Caucasians.
PCDH11X	Alzheimer's disease	A recent genome-wide study on late-onset Alzheimer's disease identified a SNP (rs5984894) on Xq21.3 in the PCDH11X gene strongly associated with LOAD individuals of European descent from the United States.
PCDH11X	Alzheimer's disease	By analyzing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in a genome-wide association study (313,504 SNPs, three series, 844 cases and 1,255 controls) and evaluating the 25 SNPs with the most significant allelic association in four additional series (1,547 cases and 1,209 controls), we identified a SNP (rs5984894) on Xq21.3 in PCDH11X that is strongly associated with LOAD in individuals of European descent from the United States.
Bim	esophageal carcinoma	In this study, we investigated the effect of Bim-1 siRNA on cell proliferation, cell cycle, cell apoptosis and migration of human esophageal carcinoma EC9706 cells, and explored its potential mechanisms.
BIM	esophageal cancer	In the present study, 4-mm samples of BIM (n=31) and CIM (n=9) were selected from esophagectomy specimens that had been resected for esophageal cancer.
HSP27	leukemia	Mechanistically, HCMV upregulated two specific cellular antiapoptotic proteins, myeloid leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), to block the two proteolytic cleavages necessary for the formation of fully active caspase 3 and the subsequent initiation of apoptosis.
HSP27	leukemia	Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) has been reported to promote the development of leukemia by protecting tumor cells from apoptosis through various mechanisms.
HSP27	leukemia	The present study investigated the effects of small hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated HSP27 knockdown on the anti-cancer effects of quercetin in U937 human leukemia cells.
HSP27	leukemia	Therefore, these findings collectively suggested that suppression of HSP27 expression amplified the anti-cancer effects of quercetin in U937 human leukemia cells, and that quercetin in combination with shHSP27 represents a promising therapeutic strategy for human leukemia.
HSP27	leukemia	Among these proteins, enolase, aldolase, HSP70 and sorcin were up-regulated in doxorubicin-resistant myelogenous leukemia cell line, whereas HSP27 was down-regulated.
Hsp27	acute             leukemia	However, the role of Hsp27 in the pathogenesis of pediatric acute             leukemia (AL) remains unknown.
Hsp27	acute myeloid leukemia	In this study, we evaluated the expression levels             of Hsp27 in bone marrow samples from 94 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic             leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 5 leukemia cell lines.
Hsp27	leukemia	Additionally,             we transfected a target-specific siRNA duplex against Hsp27 into leukemia cells,             and examined the chemosensitivity and cell apoptosis in the response to antitumor             drugs.
Hsp27	leukemia	Hsp27 was abundantly expressed in newly diagnosed AML-M4/M5 bone marrow             mononuclear cells (BMMCs) and THP-1, OCI/AML-3 leukemia cell lines.
Hsp27	leukemia	Knockdown of Hsp27 expression increased the chemosensitivity of             leukemia cells and the anticancer drug-induced apoptosis.
Hsp27	leukemia	Therefore, Hsp27 may be exploited as a new target for enhancing the             efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs against leukemia.
E-T-L	K-M-S	It was: xS-D-D-K-K-A-K-A-A-T-S-S-V-L-T-K-F-T-Q-N-Q-I-Q-E-M-K-E-A-F-T-M-I-D-Q-N-R -D-G-L- I-D-V-S-D-L-K-E-M-Y-S-N-L-G-T-A-P-Q-D-S-V-L-Q-A-M-V-K-E-A-P-Q-M-N-F-T-G- F-L-S-L- F-S-E-K-M-S-G-T-D-P-E-E-T-L-R-N-A-F-Q-M-F-D-S-D-N-T-G-Y-I-P-E-E-Y-M-K-D- L- L-E-N-M-G-D-N-F-S-K-D-E-V-R-Q-T-W-K-E-A-P-I-A-G-G-K-V-D-Y-N-A-F-V-S-K-I- K- G-K-E-Q-D-D-A.
ITGA8	Parkinson's disease	Integrin alpha 8 (ITGA8) encodes the alpha 8 subunit of the integrin alpha8beta1 protein and has recently been suggested as a new candidate gene for Parkinson's disease, an age related neurodegenerative disease with unknown etiology.
ITGA8	Parkinson's disease	Screen a Swedish case control material for rs7077361, a genetic variant in ITGA8, in order to investigate its possible implication in Parkinson's disease in Sweden.
ITGA8	Parkinson's disease	Our results do not support the hypothesis of ITGA8 as a candidate gene for Parkinson's disease in Sweden.
CYFIP1	PWS	CYFIP1 maps to the interval between proximal breakpoint 1 (BP1) and breakpoint 2 (BP2) of chromosomal 15q11-q13 deletions that are implicated in the Angelman (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).
CYFIP1	Down's syndrome	We found copy number variants in PDE10A (phosphodiesterase 10A), CYFIP1 [cytoplasmic FMR1 (Fragile X mental retardation 1)-interacting protein 1], K(+) channel genes KCNE1 and KCNE2, the Down's syndrome critical region 1 gene RCAN1 (regulator of calcineurin 1), cell-recognition protein CHL1 (cell adhesion molecule with homology with L1CAM), the transcription factor SP4 (specificity protein 4) and histone deacetylase HDAC9, among others (see http://www.genes2cognition.org/SCZ-CNV).
CYFIP1	Angelman syndrome	We describe nine cases with a microdeletion at 15q11.2 between BP1-BP2, thus having a haploinsufficiency for TUBGCP5, NIPA1, NIPA2, and CYFIP1 without Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome.
CYFIP1	PWS	Altered expression of CYFIP1 is seen in other developmental disabilities, including 15q disorders, and haploinsufficiency of CYFIP1 in Type I PWS cases may be associated with age-related phenotypic effects.
CYFIP1	PWS	Expression analysis of cultured human cells and brain tissues from PWS patients indicates that CYFIP1 and NIPA2 are biallelically expressed.
CYFIP1	Prader-Willi syndrome	Four genes (NIPA1, NIPA2, CYFIP1, and GCP5) have been identified in the chromosomal region between breakpoints 1 and 2 and are implicated in compulsive behavior and lower intellectual ability observed in individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome with TI versus TII deletions.
CYFIP1	Prader-Willi syndrome	Messenger RNA from NIPA1, NIPA2, CYFIP1, and GCP5 was reduced but detectable in the subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome with the TI deletion, supporting biallelic expression.
CD210	IL-7R	Therefore, we recruited 50 untreated house dust mite-sensitive allergic rhinitis patients and 29 non-atopic healthy individuals and performed comprehensive simultaneous flow cytometric analysis of mutual correlations between levels of CD14, CD16, CD163, CD206, CD124 (IL-4R), CD210 (IL-10R) and CD25, CD124, CD127 (IL-7R), CD210, ICOS expression on monocytes and CD4+ T cells, respectively.

Socs2	B-Cell Lymphoma	Expression of the Growth Hormone (GH)-stimulated gene Socs2 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2) is mediated by the transcription activator STAT5 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5) and the transcription repressor BCL6 (B-Cell Lymphoma 6).
SOCS2	follicular lymphoma	Gene expression analysis revealed increased expression of MAPK1, AKT1, PRKCE, IL4R and DROSHA and decreased expression of CDKN1A/p21, SOCS2, CHEK1, RAD51, KLF4, BLIMP1 and IRF4 in follicular lymphoma.
SOCS2	follicular lymphoma	miR-20a/b and miR-194 target CDKN1A and SOCS2 in follicular lymphoma, potentially contributing to tumor cell proliferation and survival.
constitutive androstane receptor	LCA	Nuclear factors such as pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), as well as transporters and conjugation enzymes involved in the detoxification of lithocholic acid (LCA), also showed higher expression in SPF mice.
constitutive androstane receptor	LCA	In this study, using transgenic mice bearing conditional expression of the activated constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), we demonstrate that activation of CAR is both necessary and sufficient to confer resistance to the hepatotoxicity of lithocholic acid (LCA).
CA VI	dental caries	These results support the conclusion that dental caries is highly affected by the activity of CA VI in saliva as well as by the salivary flow rate.
carbonic anhydrase VI	dental caries	Eleven articles found a consistent association between salivary protein polymorphisms and risk of dental caries, for proteins related to antimicrobial activity (beta defensin 1 and lysozyme-like protein), pH control (carbonic anhydrase VI), and bacterial colonization/adhesion (lactotransferrin, mucin, and proline-rich protein Db).
CA VI	dental caries	The rs17032907 genetic variant and the haplotype (ACA) of CA VI may be associated with dental caries susceptibility.
EC 4.2.1.1	dental caries	The oral pathogenic bacterium involved in human dental caries formation Streptococcus mutans, encodes for two carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) one belonging to the Alfa- and the other one to the Beta-class.

parvalbumin	autism	We used mice lacking the CNTNAP2 gene, which has been implicated in autism, and achieved a temporally precise reduction in E:I balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) either by optogenetically increasing the excitability of inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) neurons or decreasing the excitability of excitatory pyramidal neurons.
parvalbumin	autism spectrum disorder	Post-mortem analyses have demonstrated a selective reduction in the expression of parvalbumin (PV) in GABAergic interneurons in the frontal rather than the sensory cortex of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and bipolar disorders.
parvalbumin	Autism	Recent neuropathology studies in human brains indicate that several areas of the prefrontal cortex have decreased numbers of parvalbumin interneurons or decreased parvalbumin expression in Autism Spectrum disorders (ASD) [Hashemi, Ariza, Rogers, Noctor, &amp; Martinez-Cerdeno, 2017; Zikopoulos &amp; Barbas, ].
parvalbumin	autism	In view of the documented association between parvalbumin-expressing neurons and autism, the objective of the present study was to determine if parvalbumin gene expression is also altered in Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum.
parvalbumin	Autism	Our hypothesis is that parvalbumin, a molecule that controls and coordinate many cellular brain functions, contributes to the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in Autism.
parvalbumin	autism	We report that parvalbumin expression is depressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in autism.
FVL	quadriplegia	For children less than 32 weeks, FVL homozygosity may be associated with an increase in the risk of developing quadriplegia (OR 9.12, 95% CI 0.86-53.71).
NFATc3	myocardial infarction	In the myocardium activation of NFATc3 down-regulates the expression of voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channels after myocardial infarction (MI).
NFAT4	myocardial infarction	Knockdown of NFAT4 suppresses mitochondrial fission and protects cardiomyocyte from apoptosis and myocardial infarction.
WNT3A	colon cancer	The expression pattern of WNT3A is consistent with BRG1 in colon cancer tissues and WNT3A expression was inhibited in BRG1 knockdown cells.
WNT3A	colon cancer	In this study, we demonstrate that BRG1 may contribute to colon cancer progression through upregulating WNT3A expression.
Wnt3a	colon cancer	VM-positive colon cancer samples showed increased Wnt3a expression (p &lt; 0.001) and Beta-catenin nuclear expression (p &lt; 0.001) compared with the VM-negative samples.
Wnt3a	colon cancer	In vitro, over-regulated Wnt3a expression in HT29 colon cancer cells promoted the capacity to form tube-like structures in the three-dimensional (3-D) culture together with increased expression of endothelial phenotype-associated proteins such as VEGFR2 and VE-cadherin.
Wnt3a	colon cancer	However, the roles of Wnt3a, the representative canonical Wnt ligand, in EMT and colon cancer progression have not yet been fully explored.
Wnt3a	colon cancer	The expression levels of Wnt3a and EMT-associated proteins (E-cadherin, vimentin, and Beta-catenin) were assessed by immunohistochemistry in human colon cancer tissues to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of Wnt3a, as well as the correlation between Wnt3a and EMT.
Wnt3a	colon cancer	We then upregulated Wnt3a expression in HCT116 colon cancer cells, established a nude mouse xenograft model, detected the expression of EMT and Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling-associated proteins, and observed invasion and clone-initiating abilities.
Wnt3a	colon cancer	In 203 human colon cancer tissue samples, Wnt3a protein overexpression was related to colon cancer histological differentiation (P = 0.004), clinical stage (P = 0.008), presence of metastasis and recurrence (P = 0.036), and survival time (P = 0.007) of colon cancer patients.
Wnt3a	colon cancer	Wnt3a expression was associated with EMT and promoted colon cancer progression.

GH-RH	amenorrhea	To evaluate the GH-releasing hormone (GH-RH)-induced response of GH in patients affected by hypothalamic amenorrhea.
GH-RH	amenorrhea	The amenorrheic condition associated with reduced BMI changes the GH-RH--induced GH response in hypothalamic amenorrhea, supporting a GH and a IGF-I disregulation in weight-loss--related amenorrhea.
growth hormone releasing hormone	amenorrhea	We report the case of a 17-year-old girl presenting short stature (height 149 cm, below the 3rd percentile), obesity (weight 83.5 kg, body mass index 37 kg/m2) and secondary amenorrhea, in whom endocrinological evaluation disclosed an absolute lack of GH responsiveness to both suprapituitary challenges and repetitive growth hormone releasing hormone administration together with failure of plasma gonadotropins and PRL, low under basal conditions, to rise in response to GnRH and insulin-hypoglycemia, respectively.
Tspan2	neuroblastoma	Common genes include Jagged 1 (Jag1), Tetraspanin 2 (Tspan2), neuroblastoma, suppression of tumourigenicity 1 (Nbl1) and N-myc downstream regulated gene 2 (Ndrg2).
TS-N-2	neuroblastoma	While vincristine was effective against 1 out 4 neuroblastoma xenografts, TS-N-2, with 58.1% maximum inhibition rate, etoposide was assessed ineffective as a single agent in all of the 3 xenografts used.
somatostatin receptor-2	neuroblastoma	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation of somatostatin receptor-2 (SSTR2) expression with 68Ga-DOTA-TATE uptake and 177Lu-DOTA-TATE therapy in neuroblastoma (NB) xenograft models.
SSTR2	Neuroblastoma	Neuroblastoma may be treated with molecular radiotherapy, 131I meta-Iodobenzylguanidine and 177Lu Lutetium DOTATATE, directed at distinct molecular targets: Noradrenaline Transporter Molecule (NAT) and Somatostatin Receptor (SSTR2), respectively.
SSTR2	neuroblastoma	Tissue bank samples of formalin fixed paraffin embedded neuroblastoma tissue from patients for whom clinical outcome data were available were sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and monoclonal antibodies directed against NAT and SSTR2.
somatostatin receptor 2	meningioma	68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT enables detection of meningioma tissue based on somatostatin receptor 2 expression.
SSTR2	meningioma	Immunohistochemistry for the meningioma markers EMA and SSTR2A raised the possibility of intraosseous meningioma, as all 3 lesions were convincingly positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and 1 lesion was convincingly positive for the somatostatin receptor subtype 2A (SSTR2A); weak, questionable positivity for SSTR2 was present in the remaining 2 cases.
SSTR2	neuroblastoma	Somatostatine receptors subtype 2 (SSTR2) are regarded as a potential target in neuroblastoma (NB) for imaging and promising therapeutic approaches.
SSTR 2	neuroblastoma	GaTATE PET was positive in a high proportion of patients with refractory neuroblastoma, correlating with SSTR 2 on IHC, with additional disease identified compared with MIBG imaging.
SSTR2	meningioma	PET using the SSTR2 analog (68)Ga-DOTATATE has recently been introduced for imaging of meningiomas.
SSTR2	meningioma	(68)Ga-DOTATATE uptake correlates with SSTR2 expression and offers high diagnostic accuracy to delineate meningioma from tumor-free tissue even in recurrent tumors after previous therapy.
SSTR2	meningioma	We aimed to compare the frequency of perineurial marker expression in these two entities, and to determine whether somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) and progesterone receptor (PR), both expressed frequently in meningiomas, are also expressed in perineuriomas.
SSTR2	meningioma	All tumours were stained using five antibodies against antigens that are known to be expressed in perineuriomas or meningiomas: epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), claudin-1, GLUT-1 (glucose transporter-1), SSTR2, and PR.
SSTR2	meningioma	Of the meningiomas, EMA was expressed in 59 of 61, claudin-1 in five of 63, GLUT-1 in 19 of 62, SSTR2 in 59 of 68, and PR in 44 of 62.
SSTR2	meningioma	The SSTR2-positive/PR-positive phenotype was detected in 42 of 60 meningiomas, but in none of 20 perineuriomas.
SSTR2	meningioma	SSTR2 and PR are highly sensitive and, in this context, specific meningioma markers.
cPLA2 alpha	multiple sclerosis	We utilized inhibitors of cPLA2 alpha, COX-1/2 and 5-LO to determine the potential roles of these enzymes in development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS).
miR-200a-3p	hepatocellular carcinoma	This study aimed to better understand the role of miR-200a-3p and its correlation with HBx in HBV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
miR-200a	hepatocellular carcinoma	Further study suggested that lncRNA-PE downregulated miR-200a/b by repressing the primary transcript expression, enhanced ZEB1 expression, and promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
miR-200a	hepatocellular carcinoma	All these data imply that lncRNA-PE might play an important role in hepatocellular carcinoma development via the miR-200a/b-ZEB1 pathway.
miR-200a	hepatocellular carcinoma	Herein, we found that hepatocellular carcinoma cells shed more microvesicles than normal hepatocytes and miR-200a were shown to inhibit the release of microvesicles in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
miR-200a	hepatocellular carcinoma	Collectively, our findings indicate that miR-200a regulated the microvesicle biogenesis involved in the hepatocellular carcinoma progression.
miR-200a	liver cancer	Conclusions: These findings indicate that miR-200a regulates the proliferation, migration and invasion of HCC cells by targeting Foxa2, suggesting that miR-200a may function as a potential therapeutic molecular for the diagnosis and treatment of the liver cancer.
miR-200a	hepatocellular carcinoma	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)-activated by transforming growth factor beta (lncRNA-ATB) is known to be involved in the invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating target genes of miR-200a.
miR-200a	hepatocellular carcinoma	In this study, we determined that miR-200a was downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines, consistent with the results of our previous study.
Bach2	multiple sclerosis	Our data indicate that nine distinct genes associated with multiple sclerosis risk, Bach2, Il2ra, Irf8, Mertk, Odf3b, Plek, Rgs1, Slc30a7 and Thada, can be confirmed to be differentially regulated in pathogenic CD4(+) T cells.
BACH2	multiple sclerosis	Genetic polymorphisms within a single locus encoding the transcription factor BACH2 are associated with numerous autoimmune and allergic diseases including asthma, Crohn's disease, coeliac disease, vitiligo, multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes.
EPYC	PACD	However, array-based copy number analysis and qPCR were used to detect a hemizygous deletion in the PACD linkage interval containing 4 genes encoding small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs): KERA, LUM, DCN, and EPYC.
EPYC	PACD	The authors performed clinical evaluation of a previously unreported pedigree with PACD, light and electron microscopic examination of an excised corneal button, genomewide linkage analysis, fine mapping linkage and haplotype analysis, and screening of four candidate genes (KERA, LUM, DCN, and EPYC).
CD164	lung cancer	Emerging evidence indicates that elevated CD164 expression is associated with aggressive metastasis, advanced stages, and shorter overall survival in lung cancer.
CD164	lung cancer	However, no data are available regarding the clinical significance of CD164 expression in lung cancer.
CD164	lung cancer	Using tissue microarrays, we determine that CD164 expression is correlated with clinicopathological characteristics in human lung cancer.
CD164	lung cancer	Therefore, identification of CD164 as a cancer stem cell therapeutic marker may develop an effective therapy in patients with chemoresistant lung cancer.
CD164	cancer	Cluster of differentiation 164 (CD164), a sialomucin, has been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion and differentiation in multiple cancers.
CD164	glioma	However, the involvement of CD164 in human glioma proliferation and apoptosis remains unknown.
CD164	glioma	The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and oncogenic function of CD164 in normal human astrocytes (NHA) and glioma cells in vitro and in vivo.
CD164	glioma	The results of the present study demonstrated that CD164 mRNA and protein levels were significantly increased in human glioma cell lines and tissue samples.
CD164	glioma	Knockdown of CD164 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis of the U87 human glioma cell line in vitro and in vivo.
CD164	glioma	The results suggest that CD164 expression may have affected the proliferation and apoptosis of human glioma cells via the PTEN/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT pathway, and may therefore present a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of glioma.
CD164	Sezary syndrome	We recently demonstrated the high expression of CD164 on CD4+ T cells from Sezary syndrome patients with a wide range of circulating tumor burdens.
CD164	NSCLC	Our results suggest that miR-124 function as a tumor suppressor miRNA and suppress tumor proliferation and aggression by directly targeting oncogenic CD164 signaling pathway in NSCLC.
CD164	Sezary syndrome	In a cohort of patients with Sezary syndrome, CD164 expression on total CD4+ lymphocytes was significantly upregulated compared with healthy controls.
CD164	Sezary syndrome	Increased expression of CD164 may be a promising diagnostic parameter and a potential target for a CD164-linked therapeutic approach in Sezary syndrome.
CD164	medulloblastoma	These results indicate that miR-219 suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of medulloblastoma cells by targeting CD164.
AFAP1-AS	Hirschsprung disease	Despite the known engagement of the AFAP1-AS in several human diseases, its biological function in Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) remains elusive.
myoclonic epilepsy of infancy	juvenile myoclonic epilepsy	This prospective observational study included 47 patients (mean age 29 years, range 3-50) with different resistant generalized epilepsy syndromes: idiopathic generalized syndromes (IGE) 15 patients, (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy four, absence epilepsy four, myoclonic absence two, unclassified IGE five), progressive myoclonic epilepsy type 1 (PME1) four, severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) three, borderline SMEI three, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome/secondary generalized epileptic encephalopties 23 patients.
myoclonic epilepsy of infancy	JME	The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification recognizes 2 forms of myoclonic epilepsy with a good prognosis: benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (BMEI) and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME); recent studies confirm the efficacy of levetiracetam (LEV) in treating idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) in patients with myoclonic seizures.
myoclonic epilepsy of infancy	JME	We evaluated 35 patients (21 female, mean age 24.7 years) with different types of generalised epilepsies (juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (MAE), myoclonic absences (MA), benign myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (BMEI) and 4 patients had unspecified epileptic syndromes).
myoclonic epilepsy of infancy	juvenile myoclonic epilepsy	The electroclinical features suggested juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in 14 patients, progressive myoclonus epilepsy in three, progressive familial cerebellar ataxia with myoclonus in two, and severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy in one.
myoclonic epilepsy of infancy	juvenile myoclonic epilepsy	In the idiopathic generalized epilepsies we consider the benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and its reflex variant, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and palpebral myoclonias with absences.
myoclonic epilepsy of infancy	Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy	Group 5 comprises the true myoclonic epilepsies, differentiating syndromes recognized as idiopathic--such as "Benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy" and "Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy"--from those which are cryptogenic and carry a more cautious prognosis--as "Cryptogenic myoclonic and myoclonoastatic epilepsies" and "Severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy".
CEP78	retinal degeneration	Interaction studies also showed that CEP78 binds to FAM161A, another ciliary protein associated with retinal degeneration.
CEP78	retinitis pigmentosa	Altogether, our data strongly suggest that mutations in CEP78 cause a previously undescribed clinical entity of a ciliary nature characterized by blindness and deafness but clearly distinct from Usher syndrome, a condition for which visual impairment is due to retinitis pigmentosa.
FCRI	melanoma	Methods Eligible survivors had curable breast or colorectal cancer or melanoma, had completed treatment (not including endocrine therapy) 2 months to 5 years previously, were age &gt; 18 years, and had scores above the clinical cutoff on the FCR Inventory (FCRI) severity subscale at screening.
FCRI	cancer	ConquerFear participants had clinically and statistically greater improvements than control participants from T0 to T1 on FCRI total ( P &lt; .001) and severity subscale scores ( P = .001), which were maintained at T2 ( P = .017 and P = .023, respectively) and, for FCRI total only, at T3 ( P = .018), and from T0 to T1 on three FCRI subscales (coping, psychological distress, and triggers) as well as in general anxiety, cancer-specific distress (total), and mental quality of life and metacognitions (total).
FCRI	cancer	Differences in FCRI psychological distress and cancer-specific distress (total) remained significantly different at T3.
IGFR-1	cancer	Ganoderic acid interacts and modulates the signaling network in IR, IGFR-1, IGFR-2, VEGFR-1, VEFGR-2, and EGFR in cancer signaling pathways.
CD64	hematological tumors	Sixty-four patients with hematological tumors were selected and divided into the group complicated with bacterial infection (infection group, 33 cases) and the non-infection group (31 cases), the flow cytometry was be used to detect the related peripheral blood markers CD64 and CD14, the nCD64 IND and CD14 IND were calculated, and the peripheral blood WBC count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined at the same time.
FCRI	Cancer	The study objectives are to translate the FCRI in Dutch, and to explore the factor structure and the psychometric qualities of the Dutch translation of the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (FCRI-NL).
FCRI	cancer	The Severity subscale (FCRI-SF-NL) may be a valuable screening tool for fear of cancer recurrence severity in clinical care.
CD64	acute myeloid leukemia	FCI features, with single-tube 8-color combination using CD45, CD34, HAL-DR, CD11b, CD13, CD33, and CD117 and CD64, were compared for the 30 consecutive APL and 30 non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases which morphologically mimicked an APL.
FCRI	Cancer	This study aimed to confirm the cultural equivalence, reliability, and validity of the Korean version of Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory (K-FCRI).
FCRI	cancer	The psychometric property of the K-FCRI was then validated in 444 survivors from cancers at various sites.
FCRI	Cancer	The K-FCRI had significant correlations with the Korean version of Fear of Progression Questionnaire, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Version 3.0, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Fatigue Severity Score, supporting the good construct validity and psychometric properties of K-FCRI.
FCRI	cancer	The K-FCRI was confirmed as a valid and reliable psychometric test for measuring FCR of Korean survivors from cancers at various sites.
CLPB	3-methylglutaconic aciduria	Recently, CLPB deficiency has been shown to cause a genetic syndrome with cataracts, neutropenia, and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria.
CLPB	3-methylglutaconic aciduria	CLPB deficiency should be considered in neonates with absence of voluntary movements, respiratory insufficiency and swallowing problems, especially if associated with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, neutropenia and cataracts.
CLPB	3-methylglutaconic aciduria	Mutations in CLPB, SERAC1, TAZ genes were identified in neonates with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGA) as a discriminative feature.
CLPB	3-methylglutaconic aciduria	Altogether, our study suggests that disruption of CLPB causes a novel form of neonatal encephalopathy associated with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria.
CLPB	3-methylglutaconic aciduria	Taken together, mutations in CLPB define a syndrome with intellectual disability, congenital neutropenia, progressive brain atrophy, movement disorder, cataracts, and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria.
CLPB	3-methylglutaconic aciduria	We conclude that accumulation of protein aggregates underlies the development of cataracts and nephrocalcinosis in CLPB deficiency, which is a novel genetic cause of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria.
CLPB	3-methylglutaconic aciduria	We now propose that perturbation of the mitochondrial membranes by abnormal protein aggregates leads to 3-methylglutaconic aciduria in CLPB deficiency.
ClpB	Gdm	Here, we present mechanistic details about the Hsp100 chaperone inhibition by GdmCl using the Hsp104 homolog ClpB from Thermus thermophilus.
ClpB	Gdm	We present a crystal structure of ClpB NBD1 in complex with GdmCl and ADP, showing that the Gdm(+) ion binds specifically to the active site of NBD1.
secretin	nesidioblastosis	One patient with nesidioblastosis had no response to secretin, indicating that the pathophysiology of this entity is distinct from that of other forms of islet hyperplasia.
secretin	nesidioblastosis	In addition, the ability to respond to secretin appears to be lost in patients with single insulinomas and nesidioblastosis, but not in those with multiple B-cell adenomas and hyperplasia.
HLXB9	acute myeloid leukemia	In addition, HLXB9 is recurrently rearranged in young children with acute myeloid leukemia characterized by a chromosomal translocation t(7;12)-HLXB9/TEL and concomitant high expression of the unrearranged, wild-type HLXB9 allele.
HLXB9	acute myeloid leukemia	Herein, we report the clinical course of an 8-month-old patient with acute myeloid leukemia, M2 subtype and with a HLXB9/TEL rearrangement.
HLXB9	acute myeloid leukemia	Using RT-PCR, we screened members of the EHG family of homeobox genes, comprising EN1 (at 2q14), GBX2 (at 2q36), and EN2, GBX1, and HLXB9 (at 7q36), for dysregulation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines indicated by chromosomal breakpoints at these sites.
KLF5	adenoma	Previously, we showed that KLF5 is a mediator of RAS/MAPK and WNT signaling pathways under homeostatic conditions and that it promotes their tumorigenic functions during the development and progression of intestinal adenomas.
Klf5	adenoma	Moreover, production of lethal adenomas and carcinomas by specific expression of an oncogenic mutant of Beta-catenin in Lgr5(+) stem cells was suppressed completely by Klf5 deletion in the same cells.
Klf5	adenoma	Elevated levels of two particular Fbxw7 substrates, Klf5 and Tgif1, were found in normal intestine and adenomas of R482Q/+, R482Q/R482Q and Fbxw7(-/-) mice, but not Fbxw7(+/-) animals.
Klf5	intestinal tumors	Here we investigated the in vivo effect of Klf5 heterozygosity on the propensity of ApcMin/KRASV12 double transgenic mice to develop intestinal tumors.
KLF5	adenoma	To determine whether KLF5 contributes to intestinal adenoma formation, we examined tumor burdens in Apc(Min/+) mice and Apc(Min/+)/Klf5(+/-) mice.
Klf5	adenoma	Compared with Apc(Min/+) mice, Apc(Min/+)/Klf5(+/-) mice had a 96% reduction in the number of intestinal adenomas.
KLF5	adenoma	Thus, KLF5 is necessary for the tumor-initiating activity of beta-catenin during intestinal adenoma formation in Apc(Min/+) mice, and reduced expression of KLF5 offsets the tumor-initiating activity of the Apc(Min) mutation by reducing the nuclear localization and activity of beta-catenin.
KLF5	intestinal tumors	KLF5 expression was examined in intestinal tumors derived from transgenic mice expressing KRAS(V12G) under villin promoter and in human colorectal cancers with mutated KRAS.
KLF5	intestinal tumors	In vivo, both intestinal tumors derived from mice transgenic for villin-KRAS(V12G) and human primary colorectal cancers with mutated KRAS contained high levels of KLF5 and increased staining of the proliferative marker Ki67.
KLF5	intestinal tumors	Elevated levels of KLF5 protein are strongly correlated with activating KRAS mutations in intestinal tumors in vitro and in vivo.
KLF5	intestinal tumors	Ras-transformation also markedly down-regulated KLF5; further analysis indicated that reduced expression of KLF5 mRNA and destabilization of KLF5 protein occur in intestinal tumors.
KLF5	adenoma	Reduced levels of KLF5 mRNA were also detected in APC(min) mouse and human familial adenomatous polyposis adenomas compared with normal crypt epithelium, indicating that down-regulation of KLF5 is an early event in intestinal tumorigenesis in vivo.
KLF5	intestinal tumors	Collectively, these data indicate that intestinal tumor progression is associated with a change in the growth-related functions of KLF5 and that intestinal tumors down-regulate KLF5 expression by multiple mechanisms.
TNF	louse-borne relapsing fever	Variable major lipoprotein (Vmp) is a major tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inducing component of Borrelia recurrentis, the agent of louse-borne relapsing fever.
TNF	Louse-borne relapsing fever	Louse-borne relapsing fever, caused by Borrelia recurrentis, provides one of the best documented examples of the causative role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the pathology of severe infection in humans.
TNF	LBRF	Severe Jarisch Herxheimer reaction (J-HR) precipitated by antibiotic treatment of louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is associated with a transient, marked rise in circulating tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 8 (IL-8).
TNF-alpha	louse-borne relapsing fever	In patients with louse-borne relapsing fever (Borrelia recurrentis infection), antimicrobial treatment is often followed by sudden fever, rigors, and persistent hypotension (Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions) that are associated with increases in plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6, and interleukin-8.
TNF-alpha	louse-borne relapsing fever	Pretreatment with sheep anti-TNF-alpha Fab suppresses Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions that occur after penicillin treatment for louse-borne relapsing fever, reduces the associated increases in plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, and may be useful in other forms of sepsis.
situs inversus totalis	aortic stenosis	A frail 84-year old lady with situs inversus totalis and symptomatic aortic stenosis underwent a successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) after extensive diagnostic work-up.
situs inversus totalis	aortic stenosis	Here, we report the first known case of Marfan's syndrome, combined with situs inversus totalis with dextrocardia and discrete subaortic stenosis and aortic insufficiency in a 22-year-old woman.
TIE	plague	Low-frequency artifacts that plague traditional TIE methods can be suppressed without an excessive number of captured images.
hFGF16	hepatocellular carcinoma	The FGF9 subfamily, including FGF9, FGF16, and FGF20, in addition to rhFGF16, rhFGF9, and rhFGF20, were shown to stimulate the proliferation and migration of HuH7 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells.
FGF16	ovarian cancer	FGF16 promoted proliferation and invasion behavior of SKOV-3 ovarian cancer cells, whose function may be similar in lung cancer.
FGF16	ovarian cancer	This finding indicated possible involvement of FGF16 in ovarian cancer progression.
FGF16	ovarian adenocarcinoma	We observed that FGF16 stimulates the proliferation of human ovarian adenocarcinoma cells, SKOV-3 and OAW-42.
FGF16	ovarian cancer	Taken together, our findings indicate that FGF16 in conjunction with Wnt pathway contributes to the cancer phenotype of ovarian cells and suggests that modulation of its expression in ovarian cells might be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of invasive ovarian cancers.
UBR1	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome	Loss-of-function mutations in the UBR1 gene cause Johanson-Blizzard syndrome, which involves pancreatic exocrine insufficiency.
JBS	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS) is considered as an infrequent, but clinically easily recognizable autosomal recessive entity by the pathognomonic combination of congenital exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and hypoplastic alae nasi, in addition to other distinctive findings such as scalp defects, hypothyroidism, and rectourogenital malformations.
JBS	JBS	There are few reports of patients with JBS in association with facial clefting, referring all to types 2 to 6 of Tessier's classification that can be characterized properly as oblique facial clefts (OFCs).
JBS	JBS	We describe the clinical aspects in four patients with JBS and extensive OFCs.
UBR1	JBS	In all of them, the diagnosis of JBS was confirmed by the demonstration of homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in the UBR1 gene.
JBS	JBS	Additionally, we review three previously reported cases of JBS with OFCs.
JBS	JBS	Taking into account a number of approximately 100 individuals affected by JBS that have been published in the literature we estimate that the frequency of OFCs in JBS is between 5% and 10%.
JBS	JBS	This report emphasizes that extensive OFCs may be the severe end of the spectrum of facial malformations occurring in JBS.
JBS	Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome	Johanson-Blizzard Syndrome (JBS) (MIM #243800) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, abnormal facial appearance and varying degrees of mental retardation.
JBS	JBS	Here, we report a 3 year-old mentally normal JBS girl.
JBS	JBS	With these findings, JBS diagnosis was established clinically.
JBS	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS) is a rare autosomal recessive syndrome characterized by dysmorphic nasal alae, ectodermal abnormalities, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and early growth failure.
UBR1	JBS	Nonsense, frame shift and splice-site mutations of the ubiquitin ligase gene (UBR1) lead to early loss of acinar cells in individuals with JBS.
JBS	JBS	This case illustrates that the phenotypic variability of pancreatic involvement in JBS may be subtle and may not manifest until the second decade of life.
UBR1	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from loss-of-function mutations in the UBR1 gene.
JBS	JBS	JBS can be easily recognized by its unique clinical presentation (including exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, hypoplasia/aplasia of the alae nasi, congenital scalp defects, sensorineural hearing loss, growth retardation, psychomotor retardation, and anal and genitourinary anomalies).
UBR1	JBS	The objective of this study is to report on the first familial case of gender-discordant twins presenting JBS and a novel mutation in the UBR1 gene.
JBS	JBS	We also review literature describing molecularly confirmed cases of JBS.
JBS	JBS	Both patients presented typical clinical features of JBS.
UBR1	JBS	Severe presentation of JBS usually involves deleterious (nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site) mutations in the UBR1 gene that are thought to completely abolish the expression of a functional protein product, as in this familial case; however, milder presentation of JBS has occasionally been observed with missense mutations in at least 1 of the 2 copies of UBR1, in which there may be residual activity of the product of this gene.
JBS	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, typical facial features, dental anomalies, hypothyroidism, sensorineural hearing loss, scalp defects, urogenital and anorectal anomalies, short stature, and cognitive impairment of variable degree.
UBR1	JBS	Mutation types include nonsense, frameshift, splice site, missense, and small in-frame deletions consistent with the hypothesis that loss of UBR1 protein function is the molecular basis of JBS.
JBS	JBS	The review of clinical data of a large number of molecularly confirmed JBS cases allows us to define minimal clinical criteria for the diagnosis of JBS.
JBS	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, hypoplastic or aplastic nasal alae, cutis aplasia on the scalp, and other features including developmental delay, failure to thrive, hearing loss, mental retardation, hypothyroidism, dental abnormalities, and anomalies in cardiac and genitourinary systems.
JBS	JBS	We describe the case of a male infant with typical symptoms of JBS.
JBS	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS; OMIM 243800) is an autosomal recessive disorder that includes congenital exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, facial dysmorphism with the characteristic nasal wing hypoplasia, multiple malformations, and frequent mental retardation.
UBR1	JBS	Our previous work has shown that JBS is caused by mutations in human UBR1, which encodes one of the E3 ubiquitin ligases of the N-end rule pathway.
UBR1	JBS	Most JBS-causing alterations of UBR1 are nonsense, frameshift or splice-site mutations that abolish UBR1 activity.
UBR1	JBS	We report here missense mutations of human UBR1 in patients with milder variants of JBS.
UBR1	JBS	Taking advantage of this conservation, we constructed alleles of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae UBR1 that were counterparts of missense JBS-UBR1 alleles.
JBS	JBS	Among these yeast Ubr1 mutants, one of them (H160R) was inactive in yeast-based activity assays, the other one (Q1224E) had a detectable but weak activity, and the third one (V146L) exhibited a decreased but significant activity, in agreement with manifestations of JBS in the corresponding JBS patients.
UBR1	JBS	These results, made possible by modeling defects of a human ubiquitin ligase in its yeast counterpart, verified and confirmed the relevance of specific missense UBR1 alleles to JBS, and suggested that a residual activity of a missense allele is causally associated with milder variants of JBS.
JBS	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome	We report on a triplet pregnancy of consanguineous parents with one fetus being affected by recurrent Johanson-Blizzard syndrome (JBS).
JBS	JBS	In addition to the lack of exocrine acini as the characteristic feature of JBS, the pancreas revealed a resorptive inflammatory reaction with infiltration by eosinophilic granulocytes that focally dispersed onto islets of Langerhans, thus favoring a progressive destructive rather than primary dysplastic process and possibly explaining the occurrence of diabetes mellitus in later life.
UBR1	JBS	JBS maps to chromosome 15q15-q21.1 and is associated with mutations in the UBR1 gene.
UBR1	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome	Johanson-Blizzard syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder, it is characterized by the association of congenital exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and hypoplasia or aplasia of the nasal wings, and can be diagnosed by clinical characteristics and UBR1 gene analysis.
trnT	IGS	* Sixteen distinct haplotypes were detected from 258 individuals in the C. conica complex inferred from the cpDNA sequences of intergenic spacer (IGS) between atpB and rbcL, IGS between trnT and trnL, trnL intron, and IGS between trnL and trnF.
trnT	igs	Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference analyses of DNA sequence data of the plastid (the trnT-L igs, the trnL intron, two parts of the trnK intron, and the psbA-trnH igs) and nuclear genome (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2) showed these markers to be suitable to assess the species composition of sect.
trnT	IGS	However, the primers for amplification of chloroplast trnD-trnT intron and rRNA IGS failed to amplify the respective region in Elymus species.
trnT	IGS	New primer pairs were designed and successfully amplified the cpDNA trnD-trnT intron and rRNA IGS region in Elymus species.
EphrinB2	colorectal cancer	In the present study, we investigated the effect of taspine derivative 12k on human colorectal cancer targeted at EphrinB2 and its PDZ.
ephrin-B2	colorectal cancer	In this study, we investigated the mechanism of chemoresistance and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colorectal cancer involving the gain-of-function (GOF) mutant p53/ephrin-B2 signaling axis.
ephrin B2	colorectal cancer	Twenty proteins from different signaling pathways (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase [pERK], receptor for hyalouronic acid mediated motility [RHAMM], Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein [RKIP], Beta-catenin, E-cadherin, phosphorylated AK transforming [pAKT], p16, p21, Ki-67, B-cell Lymphoma-2 [BCL2], vascular endothelial growth factor, apoptosis protease activating factor 1 [APAF-1], mucin1 [MUC1], ephrin B2 receptor [EphB2], matrix metalloproteinase 7 [MMP7], phosphorylated mothers against decapentaplegic 2 [pSMAD2], caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2 [CDX2], Laminin5Gamma2, and mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1 [MST1]) involved in colorectal cancer progression were studied immunohistochemically on 220 well-characterized patients using a multiple-punch tissue microarray including 437 and 430 samples from the tumor center and the invasive front, respectively.
IP-10	dermatomyositis	Abundant expression of IFN-Gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) was observed on macrophages and in T cells in perimysial infiltrates of dermatomyositis (DM), and strong chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor (CXCR)3 expression was observed on the majority of T cells in DM.
IP-10	inclusion body myositis	Abundant expression of IP-10 was observed on macrophages and T cells surrounding and invading non-necrotic muscle fibers in polymyositis and sporadic inclusion body myositis and in T cells in perimysial infiltrates of dermatomyositis.
vesicular acetylcholine transporter	SA node	DORs were colocalized in tissue slices and synaptosomes from the canine right atrium and SA node along with cholinergic and adrenergic markers, vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH).
Bmp7	syndactyly	Furthermore, the lack of interdigital programmed cell death and associated syndactyly was related to down-regulated gene expression of Bmp2, Bmp7, Msx1, and Msx2, which are known to promote apoptosis in the interdigital mesenchyme.
ERdj3	liver disease	In this context, ERdj3 suppression may eliminate the toxic gain of function associated with polymerization of ZAAT, thus providing a potential new therapeutic approach to the treatment of AATD-related liver disease.
CPK	neuromuscular disease	The CPK, aldolase, GOT, GPT, and LDH concentrations in the serum and lumbar CSF of 80 patients with neuromuscular diseases and 20 controls were measured.
CPK	neuromuscular disease	In 60 cases of various neuromuscular diseases, serum CA-III, CPK and aldolase were measured.
Ets1	OSCC	Together, our results show that P. gingivalis activates the ERK1/2-Ets1, p38/HSP27, and PAR2/NF-kB pathways to induce proMMP9 expression, after which the proenzyme is activated by gingipains to promote cellular invasion of OSCC cell lines.
ets-1	oral squamous cell carcinoma	Tissue sections ranging from normal mucosa to moderately-differentiated oral squamous cell carcinoma were studied using monoclonal antibodies against N-ras and ets-1 proteins.
prostaglandin D2 receptor	dyslipidemia	In a randomized controlled trial of patients with dyslipidemia assigned to either extended release niacin (ERN) alone, ERN combined with the selective prostaglandin D2 receptor subtype 1 inhibitor laropiprant (ERN-L) or placebo, niacin lowered serum phosphorus; however, it is not known if it lowers FGF23 concentrations.
Ptgdr	dyslipidemia	The use of nicotinic acid to treat dyslipidemia is limited by induction of a "flushing" response, mediated in part by the interaction of prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) with its G-protein coupled receptor, DP1 (Ptgdr).
prostaglandin D2 receptor	dyslipidemia	We performed a post hoc data analysis of serum phosphorus concentrations that had been determined serially (at baseline and weeks 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24) among 1547 patients who had dyslipidemia and were randomly assigned in a 3:2:1 ratio to treatment with extended release niacin (ERN; 1 g/d for 4 weeks and dose advanced to 2 g/d for 20 weeks) combined with the selective prostaglandin D2 receptor subtype 1 inhibitor laropiprant (L; n = 761), ERN alone (n = 518), or placebo (n = 268).
mineralocorticoid receptor	congenital adrenal hyperplasia	Apart from primary aldosteronism, mineralocorticoid excess can be caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to mutations of the 11beta-hydroxylase and 17alpha-hydroxylase genes, by inactivating mutations of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (Chrousos syndrome), endogenous hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome), by mutations of the 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 gene (apparent mineralocorticoid excess/AME) or licorice/carbenoxolone intake, mutations of the epithelial sodium channel genes (Liddle syndrome), mutations of the mineralocorticoid receptor gene (Geller syndrome), and by mutations in the WNK1, WNK4, KLHL3, CUL3 genes (pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2 or Gordon syndrome).
mineralocorticoid receptor	congenital adrenal hyperplasia	We provide an overview and diagnostic approach to apparent mineralocorticoid excess, glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism, familial hyperaldosteronism type 2, Liddle's syndrome, Gordon's syndrome, activating mutations of the mineralocorticoid receptor, generalized glucocorticoid resistance and hypertensive forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
CX3CR1	neuritis	As chronic pancreatitis (CP) is characterized by tissue infiltration of inflammatory cells, fibrosis, pancreatic neuritis and severe pain, the roles of fractalkine and CX3CR1 were investigated in CP (n=61) and normal pancreas (NP, n=21) by QRT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses.
CX3CR1	neuritis	Neuro-immunoreactivity for fractalkine and CX3CR1 was strongest in patients suffering from severe pain and pancreatic neuritis.
NRL	retinitis pigmentosa	Our data suggest that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated NRL disruption in rods may be a promising treatment option for patients with retinitis pigmentosa.
NRL	night blindness	The index patients were homozygotes for both a dominant mutation of the PABPN1 gene, (GCN)13, and a recessive mutation of the NRL gene, p.R31X, on chromosome 14q11.1, leading to early-onset OPMD accompanied by night blindness and reduced visual acuity.
NRL	ESCS	Homozygosity for the recessive NRL mutation described here appears to be associated with a distinct retinal phenotype, demonstrating ERG characteristics similar to those of ESCS patients.
NRL	ESCS	This report expands the spectrum of NRL recessive mutations, as well as the genetic spectrum of ESCS, and indicates a new syndrome of OPMD with an ESCS-like phenotype.
Nrl	macular degeneration	Blue light exposure of the R91W;Nrl(-/-) mouse could therefore be used to study molecular events preceding edema formation in a cone-rich environment, and thus potentially help to develop treatment strategies for edema-based complications in macular degenerations.
CXCL2	colon cancer	CXCL6 and CXCL2 enhanced angiogenesis by HUVECs when cultured with fibroblast cells and colon cancer cells (P &lt; 0.01).
CXCL2	colorectal cancer	After quality and quantity measurements, gene expression analysis of a colorectal cancer-specific marker set with 11 genes (CA7, COL12A1, CXCL1, CXCL2, CHI3L1, GREM1, IL1B, IL1RN, IL8, MMP3, SLC5A7) was performed with array real-time PCR using Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche) and RealTime ready assays on LightCycler480 System (Roche).
CXCL2	colon cancer	These observations indicate a crucial role for TANs in the initiation and progression of CAC and suggest that the CXCL2-CXCR2 axis might be useful in reducing the risk of UC-associated colon cancer.
CXCL2	colorectal cancer	Gene expression analysis of a colorectal cancer-specific marker set (with 7 genes: COL12A1, CXCL1, CXCL2, GREM1, IL1B, IL8, SLC7A5) was performed with array real-time PCR using Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche) and RealTime ready assays on LightCycler(R) 480 System (Roche).
etanercept	psoriatic arthritis	It is approved for use in all indications for which reference etanercept is approved, including rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis and paediatric plaque psoriasis.
TUBA1A	microphthalmia	We describe the case of a boy with a TUBA1A mutation presenting with microphthalmia and congenital cataracts in addition to microcephaly and severe brain malformation.
Usp2	glomerulonephritis	We previously showed that Decorin--a leucine-rich proteoglycan inhibiting the progression of glomerulonephritis and glomerular sclerosis--can be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and deubiquitinated and stabilized by ubiquitin-specific processing protease 2-69(Usp2-69).
Usp2	nephritis	Here, we explored the effect of Usp2-69 on MC proliferation and ECM deposition by transfecting Usp2-69 plasmid into rat anti-Thy1.1 nephritis model and into cultured MCs, as well as detected Usp2-69 and Decorin in rat anti-Thy1.1 nephritis model by western blot.
Usp2	nephritis	Overexpressing Usp2-69 at the early stage, but not advanced stage, of anti-Thy1.1 nephritis alleviated cell proliferation and ECM deposition, which was shown by decreased Ki-67, Collagen IV and Fibronectin detected by immunohistochemistry.
Usp2	nephritis	In conclusion, our findings suggest that Usp2-69 overexpression alleviates the progression of rat anti-Thy1.1 nephritis and, therefore, that exogenous plasmid injection via the renal artery enhanced by electrotransfer technology could be a promising avenue for glomerular disease research.
USP2	IgA nephropathy	The proportion of USP2-69 positive area in the glomeruli was 3.90% in normal kidney, 4.96% in minimal change disease, and 4.39% in membranous glomerulonephritides, while it was 14.84% in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) (mesangial proliferative type), 16.18% in lupus nephritis (LN; diffuse proliferative type) and 15.54% in acute proliferative glomerulonephritides (APGN); the difference of the percentages between IgAN, LN (IV subtype) and APGN and normal kidney were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05).
GIRK2	Parkinson's disease	We analysed surviving human SN DA neurons from patients with Parkinson's disease and from controls, and detected elevated messenger RNA levels of D2-autoreceptors and GIRK2 in Parkinson's disease.
GIRK2	Parkinson's disease	Thus, our findings provide a novel homeostatic functional link in SN DA neurons between Cav1.3- L-type-Ca(2+) channels and D2-autoreceptor activity, controlled by NCS-1, and indicate that this adaptive signalling network (Cav1.3/NCS-1/D2/GIRK2) is also active in human SN DA neurons, and contributes to Parkinson's disease pathology.
UGT1A6	AIH-1	In conclusion, sera from AIH-1 patients reacted with the amino acids in the sequence 33-37 (PQDGS) of the N-terminal of UGT1A6.
APAF1	multiple myeloma	Several proapoptotic genes (AKT1 and AKT2) were down-regulated and antiapoptotic genes (APAF1 and BCL2L1) were up-regulated in multiple myeloma, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, compared to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.
Apaf-1	multiple myeloma	To study the role of gene promoter hypermethylation of the putative tumour suppressor genes involved in the death-associated protein (DAP) kinase/p14/HDM2/p53/Apaf-1 apoptosis pathway in multiple myeloma (MM).
microtubule-associated protein 2	seminoma	The other was a spermatocytic seminoma with focal primitive neuroectodermal differentiation: formation of Homer-Wright rosettes and perivascular pseudorosettes, with immunoreactivity for S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin, neurofilament-68 kDa, microtubule-associated protein 2, and vimentin.
ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein I	Rett syndrome	In addition to Rett syndrome and breast/ovarian cancer observed in other studies, we report evidence for the first time, to our knowledge, that overexpression of ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein I might affect mitochondrial morphology and/or physiology and lead to development of obesity and related conditions.
KRAS	colitis	From the therapeutic standpoint, colitis-associated cancers are associated with a lower prevalence of KRAS mutations than the sporadic variant.
transferrin	systemic candidiasis	In a murine acute systemic candidiasis model, C albicans strongly stimulated hepcidin, accompanied by a major reduction in transferrin saturation.
transferrin	candidiasis	On the other hand, iron overload (iron saturated transferrin) is a serious risk factor for candidiasis in newborn and in leukemic patients.
NHE1	atrial fibrillation	It has been suggested that blockade of the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1) can prevent atrial fibrillation (AF)-induced electrical remodeling and the development of AF.
trance	epilepsy	The case of a 13-year-old boy is presented and the diagnostic process discussed especially the differentiation between trance states and epilepsy.
CD3Delta	lymphopenia	The phenotype is usually T-B+NK+ SCID with lymphopenia where the clinical findings may be mild (CD3Gamma) or severe (CD3Delta, Epsilon, Zeta) owing to the underlying molecular defect.
CD3delta	lymphocytopenia	In contrast, all reported human complete CD3delta (or CD3epsilon) deficiencies are in infants with life-threatening SCID and very severe alphabeta and gammadelta T lymphocytopenia.
APDs	obesity	Although clozapine, olanzapine, and other atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) have fewer extrapyramidal side effects, they have serious metabolic side effects such as substantial weight gain, intra-abdominal obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
APDs	obesity	Given that most patients with mental disorders face chronic, even life-long, treatment with APDs, the risks of weight gain/obesity and other metabolic symptoms are major considerations for APD maintenance treatment.
APDs	obesity	Although offering many benefits for several psychiatric disorders, antipsychotic drugs (APDs) as a class have a major liability in their tendency to promote adiposity, obesity, and metabolic dysregulation in an already metabolically vulnerable population.
APDs	obesity	To describe the association between obesity and the use of antipsychotic drugs (APDs) in adult outpatients followed-up on in five Primary Care settings.
APDs	Obesity	Obesity was associated with the use of APDs [OR = 1.5 (CI: 1.3-1.8)], hypertension [OR = 2.4 (CI: 2.2-2.5)], diabetes [OR = 1.4 (CI: 1.3-1.5)] and dyslipidemia [OR = 1.3 (CI: 1.2-1.4)], p &lt; 0.0001 in all cases.
APDs	Obesity	Obesity was associated with the use of APDs, regardless of the type of drug, and with the presence of hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia.
DARs	aortic regurgitation	Higher DARs were associated with lower rates of moderate or severe paravalvular aortic regurgitation: DAR &lt;=10%, 17.6%; DAR 10% to 15%, 9.9%; DAR 15% to 20%, 6.3%; and DAR &gt;20%, 4.9%; P&lt;0.001.
end o	dracunculiasis	In 1990, Hopkins and Ruiz-Riben stated that the target date o f the end o f 1995 for the eradication of dracunculiasis is unrealistic only if it is judged to be unimportant.
HEY1	lung cancer	DLL1 influence drug resistance of small cell lung cancer through activating transcription of downstream genes HES1 and HEY1.
Hey1	lung cancer	In this study, we showed that a high percentage of lung cancer lines expressed Jagged1, Notch receptors, and their transcriptional target genes (HES1, Hey1), suggesting that the Notch pathway plays an important role in lung cancer biology.
CDC50a	lymphoma	ALPs easily insert in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane and cross the membrane via an ATP-dependent CDC50a-containing 'flippase' complex (in carcinoma cells), or are internalized by lipid raft-dependent endocytosis (in lymphoma/leukemic cells).
TMEM30A	cancer	Levels of 27 transcripts were investigated as potential novel markers for prostate cancer, including genes encoding plasma membrane proteins (ADAM2, ELOVL5, MARCKSL1, RAMP1, TMEM30A, and TMEM66); secreted proteins (SPON2, TMEM30A, TMEM66, and truncated TMEFF2 (called POP4)); intracellular proteins (CAMK2N1, DHCR24, GLO1, NGFRAP1, PGK1, PSMA7, SBDS, and YWHAQ); and noncoding transcripts (POP1 (100 kb) from mRNA AK000023), POP2 (4 kb from mRNA AL832227), POP3 (50 kb from EST CFI40309), POP5 (intron of NCAM2, accession DO668384), POP6 (intron of FHIT), POP7 (intron of TNFAIP8), POP8 (intron of EFNA5), POP9 (intron of DSTN), POP10 (intron of ADAM2, accession DO668396), POP11 (87kb from EST BG194644), and POP12 (intron of EST BQ226050)).
TMEM30A	cancer	Levels of CAMK2N1, GLO1, SDBS, and TMEM30A transcripts tended to be increased in primary prostate cancer from patients who later had biochemical failure.
CDC50A	cancer	Human CDC50A mRNA was expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells, placenta, brain and chondrosarcoma, while CDC50B mRNA was expressed in pancreatic islet, kidney, prostate as well as in lung carcinoid, parathyroid tumor, bladder tumor, meningioma and pancreatic cancer.
ephrin-B2	corneal neovascularization	Finally, ephrin-B2/Fc promoted angiogenesis in vivo in corneal neovascularization and Matrigel plug assays in adult mice, whereas LY294002 reduced angiogenesis in Matrigel that was induced by ephrin-B2/Fc.
SYNGAP1	intellectual disability	Mutations of SYNGAP1 have been frequently linked to brain disorders including intellectual disability, autisms, and seizure.
Syngap1	schizophrenia	Furthermore, the LTP-regulated phosphoproteins, which included the scaffold proteins Shank3, Syngap1, Dlgap1, and Dlg4, represented the "PSD risk" for schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder, such that without these proteins in the analysis, the association with the PSD and these two psychiatric diseases was not present.
SYNGAP1	intellectual disability	Developmental delay was the first manifestation of SYNGAP1-related encephalopathy; intellectual disability became progressively obvious and was associated with autistic behaviours in eight patients.
Flt1	obesity	The only two genes upregulated across all transcriptome-wide PE analyses to date (microarray, RNA-Seq and PAS-Seq) are NRIP1 (RIP140), a transcriptional co-regulator linked to metabolic syndromes associated with obesity, and Flt1.
Flt1	obesity	Furthermore, endothelial Flt1 gene deletion enhanced the effect of VEGFB, activating the thermogenic program in subcutaneous adipose tissue, which increased the basal metabolic rate, thus preventing diet-induced obesity and related metabolic complications.
VEGFR1	obesity	(2016) demonstrate that VEGF-B, by displacing VEGF-A from VEGFR1 and activating VEGFR2, increases adipose tissue vascularity, improves insulin sensitivity, diminishes obesity, and alleviates metabolic syndrome.
VEGFR-1	obesity	Here, we hypothesized that increased activity of PlGF/VEGFR-1 signaling mediates obesity-induced tumor progression by augmenting tumor angiogenesis and TAM recruitment/activity.
VEGFR-1	obesity	Ablation of VEGFR-1 signaling prevented obesity-induced tumor progression and shifted the tumor immune environment toward an antitumor phenotype.
VEGFR-1	obesity	Targeting PlGF/VEGFR-1 signaling reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment and inhibits obesity-induced acceleration of tumor progression.
IP-1	major depressive disorder	In a group of unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder matched for age with normal control group, we found a significant increase in 5-HT (100 microM)-induced accumulation of IP-1 (150 +/- 7% of basal for depressed patients, 132 +/- 3% for controls).
ZNF198	mastocytosis	It is hoped that the same will happen in other MPN with specific genetic alterations: polycythemia vera (JAK2 V617F and other JAK2 mutations), essential thrombocythemia (JAK2V617F and MPL515 mutations), primary myelofibrosis (JAK2 V617F and MPL515 mutations), systemic mastocytosis (KITD816V and other KIT mutations) and stem cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ZNF198-FGFR1 and other FGFR1 fusion genes).
TLR9	Common variable immunodeficiency	We show that stimulation of B-cells with the TLR9 ligands CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) prevents spontaneous and irradiation-induced death of normal peripheral blood B-cells, and of B-cells from patients diagnosed with Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID).
TLR9	CVID	Decreased IFN-Alfa secretion induced by TLR7/TLR8 activation was observed in CVID, which was recovered with TLR9 signaling.
TLR9	CVID	Our findings revealed that TLR9 activation has an adjuvant effect on the altered type I response in CVID.
TLR-9	CVID	We activated purified CVID B-cells with surrogate T-dependent (anti-CD40), T-independent (TLR-9 ligand) stimuli or through B-cell receptor engagement (anti-IgM) with or without IL-21.
TLR-9	CVID	Moreover, studies at the single cell level showed that DCs from CVID patients and healthy controls produced similar amounts of interferon-Alfa or interleukin-12 and expressed similar levels of activation markers in response to human cytomegalovirus and ligands for TLR-7 and TLR-9.
TLR-9	CVID	In conclusion, it seems unlikely that CVID is secondary to insufficient production of naturally occurring DCs or a defect in their signalling through TLR-7 or TLR-9.
TLR9	CVID	Given the established link between vitamin A deficiency and increased susceptibility to infections, we investigated the ability of the vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (RA) to restore the defective immune responses in CVID-derived B cells activated through the TLRs TLR9 and RP105.
TLR9	CVID	This can be explained by impaired RA-mediated isotype switching in TLR9/RP105-stimulated CVID-derived B cells owing to reduced induction of activation-induced deaminase.
TLR9	CVID	The ability of RA to improve critical immune parameters in CVID-derived B cells stimulated through TLR9 and RP105 support the possibility of combining RA with TLR stimulation for the treatment of CVID.
TLR9	CVID	The CD21(low) V(H)1-69(+) B cells of MC patients, like those of CVID and HIV patients, are anergic to BCR and TLR9 stimulation and display deregulation of several anergy-related genes; proliferative anergy is also observed in CD21(high) MZ-like V(H)1-69(+) B cells, that over-express the antiproliferative transcriptional repressor Stra13.
CFTR	diabetes	The secretion of glucagon by islet Alfa cells is normally suppressed by high blood glucose, but this suppressibility is impaired in patients with diabetes or cystic fibrosis (CF), a disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-activated Cl- channel.
CFTR	glucose intolerance	The results reveal that by potentiating KATP channels, CFTR acts as a glucose-sensing negative regulator of glucagon secretion in Alfa cells, a defect of which may contribute to glucose intolerance in CF and other types of diabetes.
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator	diabetes	Although Beta-cell dysfunction in cystic fibrosis (CF) leads to diabetes, the mechanism by which the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel influences islet insulin secretion remains debated.
CFTR	diabetes	Baseline estimated cost in 2008 for a hypothetical underweight, homozygous F508del-CFTR 6-year-old female without chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa/Staphylococcus aureus, CF-related diabetes (CFRD) or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and with a poor percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppFEV1) was Euro10,113, and was Euro21,082 in a 25-year-old with the same hypothetical profile.
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator	diabetes	The goal of this work was to evaluate renal function and the expression of megalin, cubilin, CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), and ClC-5 in the proximal tubule and renal cortex of rats with type 1 diabetes.
RBP 5	lichen ruber planus	Mean values in lichen ruber planus were Zn 784 micrograms/l, RBP 5.26 mg/dl and Vit A 656 ng/ml; in leukoplakia Zn 696 micrograms/l, RBP 5.30 mg/dl and Vit A 652 ng/ml; and in OSCC Zn 659 micrograms/l, RBP 5.00 mg/dl and Vit A 617 ng/ml.
galectin-3	synovitis	These observations indicate that HYA and PIIINP mainly reflect expansive synovitis proliferation while galectin-3 is more closely linked to autoimmunity, smoking and joint destructive processes.
galectin-3	synovitis	In the entire UA cohort, galectin-3 correlated with the MRI bone marrow edema score, while PIIANP correlated with the MRI erosion score, and HYA with the synovitis and erosion scores.
Galectin-3	synovitis	Previous studies have reported overexpression of Galectin-3 in RA synovitis and increased levels in synovial fluid and serum in long-standing RA compared with osteoarthritis and healthy controls.
galectin 3	synovitis	We defined by immunohistology the infiltrating cells and examined the in situ expression of plausible protagonists in synovitis of FMF: myeloperoxidase, lysozyme, galectin 1, galectin 3, p65 (RelA)/nuclear factor KB, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2, and cleaved caspase 3.
pN3	RP4	Only one of these, pFLJ2, was mobilized by the IncP plasmids RP4, pRK231 and R702, but not by plasmids pSa, R40a, R387, pN3 or R16.
ITGB3	hypertension	Changes in the frequencies of genotypes and mutant alleles of ACE, AGTR1, AGT, and ITGB3 genes were analyzed in patients with arterial hypertension coupled with metabolic syndrome (N=15) and compared with population data and corresponding parameters in patients with isolated hypertension (N=15).
ITGB3	hypertension	We examined associations between 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across ITGB3 and five CVD-related traits in the Hutterites: plasma levels of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), and lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and blood pressure or hypertension.
transforming growth factor Beta1	tympanosclerosis	The present study was performed to investigate the expressions of transforming growth factor Beta1 (TGF-Beta1) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in an experimental model of tympanosclerosis and their possible roles in the formation of this disorder.
HS6ST	glioma	RT-PCR analysis showed that the overall transcriptional activity of the main HS biosynthesis-involved genes (EXT1, EXT2, NDST1, NDST2, GLCE, HS2ST1, HS3ST1, HS3ST2, HS6ST1, HS6ST2, SULF1, SULF2, HPSE) was decreased by 1.5-2-fold in Grade II-III glioma (p &lt; 0.01) and by 3-fold in Grade IV glioma (glioblastoma multiforme, GBM) (p &lt; 0.05), as compared with the para-tumourous tissue.
HS6ST	cancer	This study aimed to analyze the expression and function of HS6ST3 in breast cancer.
HS6ST	cancer	HS6ST3 was found up-regulated in T47D, MCF7 and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell lines.
HS6ST	cancer	Silencing HS6ST3 diminished tumor cell growth, migration and invasion, but enhanced cell adhesion and apoptosis in breast cancer.
HS6ST	cancer	Gene microarray analysis revealed that silencing HS6ST3 significantly changed the expression of IGF1R and XAF1 in breast cancer cells.
HS6ST	cancer	Further functional studies showed that the cellular processes were mediated by IGF1R and XAF1 after silencing HS6ST3 in breast cancer cells.
HS6ST	cancer	Together these results indicate that HS6ST3 might be involved in the tumorigenesis of breast cancer and it could be a promising target in breast cancer therapy.
HH15	hepatocellular carcinoma	We aimed to examine the relationship between the preoperative GSA index [uptake ratio of the liver to the liver plus heart at 15 min (LHL15) to uptake ratio of the heart at 15 min to that at 3 min (HH15) ratio] calculated from 99mTc-labeled diethylene triamine pentaacetate-galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) scintigraphy and background liver fibrosis and to investigate whether the GSA index can be a useful predictor in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with surgical resection (SR).
HS6ST	cancer	Here we demonstrate that HS 6-O-sulfotransferases 1 and 2 (HS6ST-1 and HS6ST-2), which perform sulfation at 6-O position in glucosamine in HS, impact ovarian cancer angiogenesis through the HS-dependent HB-EGF/EGFR axis that subsequently modulates the expression of multiple angiogenic cytokines.
HS6ST	cancer	Down-regulation of HS6ST-1 or HS6ST-2 in human ovarian cancer cell lines results in 30-50% reduction in glucosamine 6-O-sulfate levels in HS, impairing HB-EGF-dependent EGFR signaling and diminishing FGF2, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA and protein levels in cancer cells.
HS6ST	cancer	Our results show that in addition to the critical role that 6-O-sulfate moieties play in angiogenic cytokine activation, HS 6-O-sulfation level, determined by the expression of HS6ST isoforms in ovarian cancer cells, is a major regulator of angiogenic program in ovarian cancer cells impacting HB-EGF signaling and subsequent expression of angiogenic cytokines by cancer cells.
HS6ST	chondrosarcoma	We have investigated whether the expression of HS6STs and SULFs changes during chondrosarcoma progression and have determined 6O-sulphation levels in two chondrosarcoma cell lines.
HS6ST	chondrosarcoma	Immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays of chondrosarcomas showed that HS6ST3 and SULF1 were highly expressed in most chondrosarcomas, whereas SULF2 expression was absent in most cases.
HS6ST	chondrosarcoma	HS6ST1 and HS6ST2 expression are significantly increased during chondrosarcoma progression, which suggest that 6O-sulphation is increased during progression.
HS6ST	chondrosarcoma	In conclusion, our results show increased HS6ST1 and HS6ST2 expression during chondrosarcoma progression and increased HS 6O-sulphation in vitro.
HS6ST	chondrosarcoma	As 6O-sulphation plays an important role in signal transduction, altered HS6ST expression might be associated with changes in signal transduction pathways in chondrosarcoma progression.
CXCR3	osteoarthritis	Thus, neutrophils and NK cells act as important disease-promoting immune cells in experimental osteoarthritis and their functional interaction is promoted by the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis.
SMARCD1	cancer	Ovarian cancer cell line OC316 was reverse transfected with a miR-223 mimic and relative expression levels of miR-223 and SMARCD1 were quantified by RT-PCR; protein expression of SMARCD1 was evaluated by Western Blot.

SLC2A9	gout	The genotypic distribution of SLC2A9/GLUT9 rs1172228 in male gout patients did not differ significantly from that of healthy male controls.
solute carrier family 2, member 9	gout	The relationship between the SLC2A9 (solute carrier family 2, member 9) gene polymorphisms and gout was still inconsistent among the individual genetic association studies.
SLC2A9	gout	Therefore, this present research was aimed to systematically evaluate the association between SLC2A9 gene polymorphisms and gout susceptibility.
SLC2A9	gout	This study demonstrated that the genetic susceptibility for gout is associated with the SLC2A9 gene polymorphisms.
SLC2A9	gout	Eight variants of ABCG2, SLC2A9, SLC22A12, SLC22A11 and SLC17A3 were genotyped in male individuals in a case-control study with 157 gout (33% tophi), 106 asymptomatic hyperuricaemia and 295 control subjects from Taiwan.
SLC2A9	gout	ABCG2 Q141K (T), SLC2A9 rs1014290 (A) and SLC22A12 rs475688 (C) under an additive model and alcohol use independently predicted the risk of gout (respective odds ratio for each factor=2.48, 2.03, 1.95 and 2.48).

Zrs	asthma	Comparison of the Zrs z-scores between the healthy children and the health groups found significant differences in children with asthma, current wheeze and respiratory symptoms, but not in children born preterm or with early-life wheeze.
Zrs	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	The aim of this retrospective study was to assess responses to a bronchodilator by forced oscillation technique (FOT) and to relate the results of respiratory impedance (Zrs) to spirometric parameters in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Zrs	asthma	The diagnostic efficiency of Zrs, R5 and X35 when diagnosis asthma, expressed by ROC curve parameters, was as follows: AUC (0.721, 0.710, 0.695), sensitivity (62%, 72%, 53%) and specificity (72%, 61%, 76%), respectively.
Zrs	asthma	And R5, X35 and Zrs may provide useful IOS parameters for asthma.
Zrs	bronchial hyper-reactivity	Birth weight less than 3,000 g was associated with larger exercise-induced changes in Zrs and Rrs at 5 Hz, and in reactance (Xrs) at 5 Hz, than those with birth weight more than 3,000 g. Preliminary evidence was found that obesity may be associated with airway obstruction, but not with bronchial hyper-reactivity.
uromodulin	multiple myeloma	To investigate the nature of mutations in exons 4 and 5 of the uromodulin (UM) gene, including in the area encoding the domain of 8 cysteines (D8C), in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) with the secretion of monoclonal light chains (LC) in cast nephropathy (CN) and without kidney injury.

uromodulin	renal cell carcinoma	In patients diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma and treated with surgery, uromodulin homozygous genotype is associated with more aggressive renal cell carcinoma clinical and pathological characteristics.
UMOD	primary aldosteronism	CYP11B2 was sequenced if the aldosterone level was high (primary aldosteronism phenotype); SCNN1B, NEDD4L, GRK4, UMOD, and NPPA genes were sequenced if the aldosterone level was low (Liddle phenotype).
MT1X	colon cancer	MT1F, MT1G, MT1X, and MT2A gene expression was significantly downregulated in colon cancer tissue (p&lt;0.05).
metallothionein 1X	colorectal cancer	Here, we describe the discovery of a new MSI marker for colorectal cancer located in the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR, T20 mononucleotide repeat) of the metallothionein 1X gene (MT1XT20).
MT1X	colorectal cancer	Indeed, MT1XT20 instability was detected in 36 out of 37 cases (97.3%) of MSI-high colorectal cancers, whereas no MT1XT20 alterations were observed in 254 MSS or in 46 MSI-low cases.
LARG	endometriosis	HNF-1Beta regulates tissue-specific gene expression in endometriosis, as well as the expression of several genes, including CD44v9, which binds several molecules, including hyaluronan, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), leukemia-associated Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG), IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1), macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), major histocompatibility complex, class II invariant chain (CD74), cystine transporter subunit (xCT), Fas and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.
l-arg	CKD	We sought to determine whether oxidative stress or a relative deficit of l-arginine plays a role in reducing cutaneous vasodilation in response to local heating in chronic kidney disease (CKD).
l-Arg	CKD	Eight patients with stage 3-4 CKD and eight age- and sex-matched healthy control (HC) subjects were instrumented with four microdialysis (MD) fibers for the local delivery of 1) Ringers solution (R), 2) 20 mM ascorbic acid (AA), 3) 10 mM l-arginine (l-Arg), and 4) 10 mM N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME).
l-Arg	CKD	The plateau %CVC(max) in the CKD group was significantly greater at the AA and l-Arg sites compared with R (AA: 89 +/- 2; l-Arg: 90 +/- 1; R: 76 +/- 4; P &lt; 0.05) and did not differ from HC.
l-Arg	CKD	Initial peak %CVC(max) was also significantly attenuated at the R and l-Arg sites in CKD (P &lt; 0.05) but did not differ at the AA site.
l-arg	CKD	These results suggest that cutaneous microvascular function is impaired in stage 3-4 CKD and that oxidative stress and a deficit of l-arginine play a role in this impairment.
L-arg	renal failure	If true, plasma L-arg should be severely reduced in chronic renal failure (CRF); however, plasma L-arg is frequently unchanged in CRF.
l-arg	proteinuria	l-arg, by its cytoprotective effect, maintained the thiol status, thereby preserving the activities of the membrane bound ATPases and preventing proteinuria and subsequent weight loss in EG-treated rats.
aminopeptidase M	analgesia	As expected, a physiological analgesia is produced by administration of inhibitors, especially kelatorphan and analogues, demonstrating unambiguously the implication of enkephalinase and aminopeptidase M in enkephalin metabolism.
CD13	autism	Associated with antigliadin and anti-HSP antibodies, children with autism and patients with autoimmune disease developed anti-dipeptidylpeptidase I (DPP I), anti-dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV [or CD26]) and anti-aminopeptidase N (CD13) autoantibodies.

AXIN	renal cell carcinoma	The purpose of the present study is to investigate the association between the polymorphisms in AXIN1 with susceptibility to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).
Axin	melanoma	In both cultured melanoma cell lines and in vivo in melanoma cell-derived tumor xenografts, 1-benzyl-I3C disrupted canonical Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling that resulted in the down regulation of Beta-catenin protein levels with a concomitant increase in levels of the Beta-catenin destruction complex components GSK3Beta and Axin.
Axin	cancer	Here, we showed that SKL2001, which has been identified as an activator for Wnt signaling by disrupting the Axin/Beta-Catenin complex, negatively regulates growth of colon cancer spheroids cultured in the 3D condition that simulates tumor microenvironment in vivo.
PGRN	Alzheimer's disease	Defective lysosomal function defines many neurodegenerative diseases, such as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) and Niemann-Pick type C (NPC), and is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP) with progranulin (PGRN) deficiency.
Grn	Alzheimer's disease	Moreover, recent findings indicate that Grn mutations are associated with other neurodegenerative disorders with tau pathology, including Alzheimer's disease.
PGRN	Alzheimer's disease	Together, these critical roles in the CNS suggest that PGRN has the potential to be an important therapeutic target for the treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD).
PNFA	Alzheimer's disease	Pathological examination revealed Alzheimer's disease in three cases (all LPA), pathological PSP in two cases (one clinical PSP and one PNFA) and corticobasal degeneration in one case (PNFA).
Granulin	Alzheimer's disease	Granulin mutations were initially found in tau-negative patients, though recent findings indicate that these mutations are associated with other neurodegenerative disorders with tau pathology, including Alzheimer's disease and corticobasal degeneration.
CEBPG	cancer	Inter-individual variation in CCAAT/enhancer binding protein gamma (CEBPG) transcript expression in normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NBEC) is associated with predisposition to lung cancer.
CEBPG	cancer	These data support the hypothesis that genetic variation in linkage disequilibrium with rs2772 influences regulation of CEBPG transcript expression through a trans-effect downstream of RNA polymerase II transcription and confirm that cis-acting genetic variation contributes to inter-individual variation in CEBPG transcript expression in NBEC, which is associated with variation in lung cancer risk.
CEBPG	cancer	In an effort to develop a biomarker for lung cancer risk, we evaluated the transcript expressions of 14 antioxidant, DNA repair, and transcription factor genes in normal bronchial epithelial cells (HUGO names CAT, CEBPG, E2F1, ERCC4, ERCC5, GPX1, GPX3, GSTM3, GSTP1, GSTT1, GSTZ1, MGST1, SOD1, and XRCC1).

CBS	focal hand dystonia	We report a patient that presented with the corticobasal syndrome (CBS), including progressive dementia, asymmetric parkinsonism associated with constructional and ideomotor apraxia, action myoclonus and focal hand dystonia.
MAP4K3	Sezary syndrome	Fifteen rearrangements detected in Sezary syndrome patients and SeAx resulted in an expression of new fusion transcripts, nine of them were in frame (EHD1-CAPN12, TMEM66-BAIAP2, MBD4-PTPRC, PTPRC-CPN2, MYB-MBNL1, TFG-GPR128, MAP4K3-FIGLA, DCP1A-CCL27, MBNL1-KIAA2018) and five resulted in ectopic expression of fragments of genes not expressed in normal T-cells (BAIAP2, CPN2, GPR128, CAPN12, FIGLA).
MAP4K3	cancer	In addition, we found eleven potential cancer-related genes with mutations (EZH1, SPOP, NF1, TCF12, IGF2BP3, KMT2C, CNOT1, BRIP1, KDM5C, STAG2 and MAP4K3) that have not been reported in thyroid follicular tumors.
MAP4K3	NSCLC	Since GLK (also named MAP4K3) induces activation of NF-KB, which contributes to tumor progression, we investigated the role of GLK in NSCLC.
GLK	NSCLC	GLK protein levels of 190 samples from pulmonary tissue arrays and 58 pulmonary resection samples from stage I to stage III NSCLC patients were studied using immunohistochemistry or immunoblotting.
GLK	NSCLC	High levels of GLK proteins were detected in pulmonary tissues from NSCLC patients.
GLK	NSCLC	Elevated GLK protein levels were correlated with increased recurrence risks and poor recurrence-free survival rates in NSCLC patients after adjusting for pathologic stage, smoking status, alcohol status, and EGFR levels.
GLK	NSCLC	Thus, GLK is a novel prognostic biomarker for NSCLC recurrence.
Map4k3	cancer	RNA fusion-based CISs were identified corresponding to both DNA-based CISs (Cdkn2a, Mycl1, Nf2, Pten, Sema6d, and Rere) and additional regions strongly associated with cancer that were not observed by LM-PCR (Myc, Akt1, Pth, Csf1r, Fgfr2, Wisp1, Map3k5, and Map4k3).
MAP4K3	cancer	Computationally, PTPRF, PRKAR2B, MAP4K3, and RICTOR were calculated as highly drug-targetable genes for breast cancer.
TMSB15A	breast cancer	In the GeparTrio FFPE training cohort, a significant linear correlation between TMSB15A expression and pCR was apparent in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (n=61, P=0.040).
TMSB15A	prostate cancer	In normal human prostate and prostate cancer tissues, TMSB15A was the predominant isoform expressed.
TMSB15B	colon cancer	In contrast, normal colon and colon cancer tissue expressed predominantly TMSB15B.
TMSB15B	breast cancer	Treatment of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with transforming growth factor beta 1 repressed TMSB15A expression but had no effect on TMSB15B.
TMSB15B	prostate cancer	siRNA specific to the TMSB15B isoform suppressed cell migration of prostate cancer cells to epidermal growth factor, suggesting a functional role for this second isoform.
Tb15	prostate cancer	We showed earlier that human beta-thymosin 15 (Tb15) is up-regulated in prostate cancer, confirming studies from others that propagated Tb15 as a prostate cancer biomarker.
Tb15	prostate cancer	Tb15r is present also in mouse prostate cancer cell lines.
TB 15	lymphoma	In those patients with isolated adenopathy the following diagnoses were reached; sarcoidosis 23, TB 15, lymphoma 4, carcinoma 4, no diagnosis 1.
Tb15	prostate cancer	However, in this report we provide evidence that TbNB, initially identified in human neuroblastoma, is the only Tb isoform upregulated in human prostate cancer and that the Tb15 sequence is not present herein.
NB thymosin beta	neuroblastoma	Human NB thymosin beta is a beta-thymosin originally found in neuroblastoma.
Upk1b	hydronephrosis	Our studies provide the first evidence that Upk1b is directly associated with the development of congenital anomalies of the urinary tract (CAKUT), spontaneous age-dependent hydronephrosis, and dysplastic urothelia.
Upk1b	hydronephrosis	Upk1b(RFP/RFP) mice developed age-dependent progressive hydronephrosis.
5-hydroxytryptamine	Parkinson's disease	The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and spinal cord in pain sensory abnormalities in a 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rat model of Parkinson's disease.
5-hydroxytryptamine	Parkinson's disease	Conclusions These results suggest that the decreased 5-hydroxytryptamine contents in the rostral ventromedial medulla and spinal dorsal horn may be involved in hyperalgesia in the 6-hydroxydopamine-induced rat model of Parkinson's disease.
5-HT7	Parkinson's disease	The role of serotonin7 (5-HT7) receptors in the regulation of depression is poorly understood, particularly in Parkinson's disease-associated depression.

miR-92a-3p	cirrhosis	For this reason, the expression levels of 24 miRNA (let-7c, miR-92a-3p, 423-5p, 150-5p, 223-3p, 125b-5p, 342-3p, miR-206, 122-5p, 375, 223-5p, 10a-5p, 23b-5p, 99a-5p, 23a-5p, 10a-3p, 122-3p, 125b-1-3p, 23b-3p, 125b-2-3p, 23a-3p, 92a-1-5p, 92a-2-5p, 99a-3p) were analyzed in plasma of patients with chronic hepatitis B, HBV-positive cirrhosis and HBV-positive HCC and compared with control group samples.
Bhlhb2	ADHD	Consistently, Bhlhb2 expression was significantly higher in PFC of ADHD model SHR than control.
BHLHE40	WTs	We examined ANG expression in WTs, human fetal kidney (FK) and childhood kidney (NK) samples and studied its relationship with microvascular density (MVD) and with three other hypoxia-induced angiogenic factors: lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) and BHLHE40 (basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor E40).
BHLHE40	WTs	ANG, CD31, VEGFA and BHLHE40 mRNA levels were significantly lower in 15 WTs compared with matched-paired NKs.
SLC5A5	hypothyroidism	Mutations in the SLC5A5 gene encoding NIS that result in a non-functional protein lead to congenital hypothyroidism due to I- transport defect (ITD).
sodium-iodide symporter	hyperthyroidism	Thyroid concentrates radioactive iodine by sodium-iodide symporter; this is used for treating hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer.
sodium iodide symporter	goiter	In this study, we investigated the relationship between iodine content and sodium iodide symporter (NIS) expression by using the clinical specimens from patients with nodular goiter and explored the pathogenesis triggered by iodine deficiency in nodular goiter.
FGF-21	B-cell lymphoma	The same technique was used for the assays of the hepatic levels of FGF-21, silent information regulator (SIRT1), malondialdehyde (MDA),IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-Alfa (TNF-Alfa) as well as the apoptotic markers; caspase-3 and B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-2).
FUS	respiratory failure	We report here the case of a 25-year-old woman with a bulbar onset ALS that progressed in less than 12 months to invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure; Genetic screening identified a new mutation in the FUS gene that lies within the last codon.
Grb2	renal cell carcinoma	The expression and biological function of Grb2-associated binding 2 (Gab2) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells was tested here.
Grb2	bladder cancer	However, the significance of Grb2 and Sos proteins, which is related to EGF-triggered Ras activation, has not been elucidated in human bladder cancer.
Grb2	bladder cancer	On the other hand, expression of Grb2 and Sos proteins was substantially increased in all human bladder cancer cell lines examined in comparison with cultured normal urothelial cells, whether codon 12 of H-ras was mutated or not.
Grb2	bladder cancer	These results suggest that the amplification of both Grb2 and SOS proteins plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of human bladder cancer.
3 in 7	bladder cancer	In the 32 patients studied, bladder cancer was diagnosed as pTaG1-2 in 8 cases, pT1G2 in 6, pT1G3 in 7, pT2G2-3 in 7, pT3G2-3 in 3 and pT4 in 1 patient.
Wnt2B	ovarian cancer	In this study, we investigated whether silencing Wnt2B expression could inhibit the invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells and reduce drug resistance.
Wnt2B	ovarian cancer	These data suggest that Wnt2B indeed plays an important role in ovarian cancer metastasis and drug resistance.
WNT2B	cervical cancer	WNT2B is expressed in several types of human cancer, such as basal cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, head/neck squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer and leukemia.
Wnt-13	cervical cancer	Among various cancer cell lines, the Wnt-13 mRNA was detected in HeLa (cervical cancer), MKN28 and MKN74 (gastric cancer).
PTPRG	autism	The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRG has been genetically associated with psychiatric disorders and is a ligand for members of the contactin family, which are themselves linked to autism spectrum disorders.
PTPRG	schizophrenia	Based on our finding of a phosphatase-null de novo mutation in PTPRG associated with a case of sporadic schizophrenia, we used PTPRG knockout (KO) mice to model the effect of a loss-of-function mutation.
PTPRG	schizophrenia	The most notable behavioral consequences of PTPRG gene inactivation were reduced immobilization in the forced swim test, suggestive of some negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
PTPRG	attention deficit disorder	The subgroups significantly differed in important features, including specific working memory deficits for PTPRG (n=5); severe negative symptoms, global cognitive deficits and poor educational attainment, suggesting a developmental disorder, for SLC39A13 (n=4); slow processing speed, childhood attention deficit disorder and milder symptoms for TGM5 (n=4); and global cognitive deficits with good educational attainment suggesting neurodegeneration for ARMS/KIDINS220 (n=5).
PTPRG	schizophrenia	First, whole exome sequencing was conducted to identify disruptive de novo mutations in 14 complete parent-offspring trios with sporadic schizophrenia from Jerusalem, which identified 5 sporadic cases with de novo gene mutations in 5 different genes (PTPRG, TGM5, SLC39A13, BTK, CDKN3).
PTPRG	schizophrenia	Next, targeted exome capture of these genes was conducted in 48 well-characterized, unrelated, ethnically diverse schizophrenia cases, recruited and characterized by the same research team in New York (NY sample), which demonstrated extremely rare and potentially damaging variants in three of the five genes (MAF&lt;0.01) in 12/48 cases (25%); including PTPRG (5 cases), SCL39A13 (4 cases) and TGM5 (4 cases), a higher number than usually identified by whole exome sequencing.
RPTPGamma	Alzheimer's disease	Activated astrocytes were found to be strongly positive for RPTPGamma also in a mice model of Alzheimer's disease.
CXCL1	uveitis	Aqueous humor (AH) samples from 14 patients with presumed tuberculous uveitis (PTU), and 30 control patients were assayed for the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin IL-4, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, interferon (IFN)-Gamma, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Alfa, the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10, and the chemokines GRO-Alfa/CXCL1, IL-8/CXCL8, MIG/CXCL9, IP-10/CXCL10 and SDF-1/CXCL12 with the use of a multiplex assay.
CXCL1	uveitis	Aqueous humor (AH) samples from patients with Behcet's disease (BD) (n=29), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease (n=21), and HLA-B27-associated uveitis (n=8), and 42 control patients were assayed for the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1/GRO-Alfa and CXCL8/IL-8 and the lymphocyte chemoattractants CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP-10 and CXCL12/SDF-1 with the use of a multiplex chemokine assay.
GRO	uveitis	In patients with the same disease activity, AH levels of GRO-Alfa and IP-10 were significantly higher in patients with BD than in patients with VKH disease and HLA-B27-associated uveitis (p=0.0474; p&lt;0.001, respectively).
GRO	uveitis	These data suggest that GRO-Alfa and IP-10 are the predominant CXC chemokines involved in neutrophil and activated T lymphocyte chemoattraction in endogenous uveitis, particularly in BD.
GRO	uveitis	The purpose of this study was to investigate the role and regulation of the CXC chemokine GRO and the interaction between GRO and IL-8 in LPS-induced uveitis in rabbits.
GRO	uveitis	Taken together, our results suggest that GRO is an essential mediator for neutrophil infiltration in LPS-induced uveitis in rabbits.
NKCC1	Meniere's disease	Na(+)K(+)ATPase, NKCC1, and alpha-syntrophin were expressed within sensory epithelia and were unaltered in Meniere's disease specimens.
HbAc1	cancer	Although an elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbAc1) level is an independent predictor of worse survival in patients with both digestive cancer and diabetes mellitus, its relationship to short-term prognosis in these patients has not been addressed.
ADCY3	cancer	We identified novel driver mutations that developed during adenoma and cancer evolution, particularly in OR1B1 (GPCR signaling pathway) for adenoma evolution, and LAMA1 (PI3K-Akt signaling pathway) and ADCY3 (FGFR signaling pathway) for CRC evolution.
ADCY8	glioma	Recently, we provided human validation for a cooperating oncogenic role for cAMP in brain tumorigenesis when we found that SNPs in ADCY8 were correlated with glioma (brain tumor) risk in individuals with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).
ADCY8	glioma	However, the cAMP pathway is well-known to be sexually dimorphic, and SNPs in ADCY8 affected glioma risk in a sex-specific fashion, elevating the risk for females while protecting males.
ADCY8	glioma	Here, we report genetic polymorphisms in the human adenylate cyclase gene adenylate cyclase 8 (ADCY8) that correlate with glioma risk in NF1 in a sex-specific manner, elevating risk in females while reducing risk in males.
ADCY8	glioma	Overall, our results establish a sex-specific role for cAMP regulation in human gliomagenesis, specifically identifying ADCY8 as a modifier of glioma risk in NF1.
delta 6 desaturase	hepatoma	The effect of insulin on the oxidative desaturation of 1-14C palmitic acid to palmitoleic acid (delta 9 desaturase) 1-14C linoleic acid to alpha-linolenic acid (delta 6 desaturase) on rat liver microsomes and 1-14C eicosa-8,11,14-trienoic acid to arachidonic acid (delta 5 desaturase) on rat liver microsomes and hepatoma tissue culture (HTC) cells was studied.
CALCA	adenocarcinomas	Methylation of CALCA, CDH1, DAPK1, and EVX2 was more common in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) compared to adenocarcinomas (ADC).
CALCA	adenocarcinomas	Overall, CALCA, DAPK, ESR1, TIMP3, APC and RAR-beta2 promoters were significantly more often hypermethylated in cancers than in controls, while adenocarcinomas were more often hypermethylated above the highest control ratio for APC, TIMP3 and RASSF1A promoters.
CALCA	adenocarcinomas	Combining 4 genes (CALCA, DAPK, ESR1 and APC) yielded a sensitivity of 89% (with all adenocarcinomas identified), equal to cytomorphology (89%) and high-risk human papilloma virus (Hr-HPV; 90%).
calcitonin	adenocarcinoma	The thyroid tumor was diagnosed as metastasis to the thyroid from lung adenocarcinoma, because it showed mucin production, positive immunoreactivity for carcinoembryonic antigen and negative immunoreactivities for thyroglobulin and calcitonin.
Sept 1	relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis	We searched Medline for clinical trials that assessed disease-modifying drugs for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis published from Sept 1, 2008, to Oct 31, 2012.
SEPT1	Alzheimer's disease	SEPT1, SEPT4, and SEPT2 have been found in deposits known as neurofibrillary tangles and glial fibrils in Alzheimer's disease.
NPSR	CRF	Finally, we evaluated the effect of the pro-arousal neuropeptides CRF and Hcrt-1/Ox-A in NPSR-deficient mice.
NPSR	CRF	The administration of CRF and Hcrt-1/Ox-A, two classic pro-arousal peptides, elicited the same effects in both NPSR(-/-) and wild type mice, ruling out the possibility that adaptive mechanisms occurring at the level of these two systems could have occurred during NPSR(-/-) development to compensate for the lack of NPSR receptors.
NPSR	CRF	Moreover, we demonstrated that the deletion of NPSR did not lead to compensatory changes in the vigilance-promoting effects of the CRF and Hcrt-1/Ox-A systems.
NPS R	CKD	We included all RCTs of any calcimimetic agent, cinacalcet HCl (AMG-073, Sensipar), NPS R-467 or NPS R-568 administered to patients with CKD for the treatment of SHPT.
NPS R	renal failure	Renal osteodystrophy (RO) due to secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in chronic renal failure was an obvious target for studying the effects of NPS R-568.
VISTA	parasagittal meningioma	Changes in BIS (bispectral index) VISTA bilateral monitoring system associated with intraoperative episodes of generalized and focal seizures, during total intravenous anesthesia for resection of a left frontal parasagittal meningioma, are herein described.
PARP	Fanconi's anemia	Previous studies identified a variety of putative target genes from several pathways associated with DNA damage repair, chromatin remodeling complex, PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, Notch signaling, cell cycle checkpoint signaling, BRCA-associated complex and Fanconi's anemia susceptibility genes that could be used as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for PARP inhibition.
PARP	anemia	Hematologic toxicities, including neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia, are major adverse effects of PARP inhibitors (PARPis), but the incidence rate and overall risk has not been systematically studied.
PARP	anemia	A total of 2,479 patients from 12 RCTs revealed that the incidence of PARPi-associated severe hematologic toxicities was, respectively: neutropenia: 32.9% (95% CI, 20.5%-48.3%); thrombocytopenia: 15.9% (95% CI, 9.5%-25.4%), and anemia: 9.1% (95% CI, 5.1%-15.7%).
vasoactive intestinal peptide	Cushing's syndrome	Examples of endocrine syndromes are classical carcinoid syndrome caused by serotonin (measured in the urine as its metabolite 5-HIAA), insulinoma syndrome caused by insulin or proinsulin, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome resulting from gastrin secretion, glucagonoma syndrome caused by glucagon, WDHA syndrome caused by vasoactive intestinal peptide, or Cushing's syndrome resulting from ectopic production of adrenocorticotropic hormone or corticotropin-releasing hormone.
vasoactive intestinal peptide	Cushing's disease	We have previously reported and confirmed that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a significant stimulator of ACTH and cortisol secretion in at least some patients with Cushing's disease.
VIP	Cushing's disease	We have also found that the hormonal responses to corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in VIP-responsive patients with Cushing's disease were higher than those in VIP non-responders, which suggested a linkage between the actions of CRH and VIP in this disorder.
VIP	Cushing's disease	This study is the first to demonstrate the parallel inhibition by DEX of ACTH and cortisol responses to CRH and VIP in Cushing's disease.
VIP	Cushing's disease	Of the patients with Cushing's disease, 9 (75%) were responsive to hCRH, 5 (42%) were to VIP, and 3 (25%) were to PHM, showing significant increases in both ACTH and cortisol.
VIP	Cushing's disease	In addition, in the patients with Cushing's disease the coadministration of hCRH with PHM or VIP produced additive increases in both ACTH and cortisol.
VIP	Cushing's disease	Abnormalities in hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis function were demonstrated by measuring plasma adrenocorticotropin abnormal concentrations following Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) and Corticotropin Releasing Hormone (CRH) administration during a phase of remission of Cushing's disease in a 45-year-old female patient.
VIP	Cushing's disease	We conclude that the study of ACTH and cortisol response to VIP and CRH may be useful in revealing Cushing's disease even during a remission phase of the disorder.
AP-A	EAD	Here we introduce a cell culture model of EAD propagation consisting of monolayers of cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes treated with anthopleurin-A (AP-A).
AP-A	EAD	The present study provides evidence in support of the hypothesis that AP-A-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias are due to bradycardia-dependent EAD and triggered activity.
AP-A	EAD	TU alternans was investigated by MAP recordings in six normal dogs, following the administration of anthopleurin-A (AP-A), a drug shown to delay sodium inactivation and to induce bradycardia dependent long QTU, EADs, and TdP.
kalirin	Alzheimer's disease	Moreover, a series of recent studies have genetically and functionally linked kalirin signaling to several disorders, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.
kalirin	Alzheimer's disease	A series of recent studies has improved our understanding of spine dynamics by establishing kalirin-7 as an important regulator of dendritic spine development as well as structural and functional plasticity, providing a model for the molecular control of structural plasticity and implicating kalirin-7 in synaptic pathology in several disorders including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.
Cdk9	EKC	Here, we report that inhibition of the cell cycle-dependent kinase 9 (Cdk9) by RNA interference, or the compound flavopiridol, blocked infections with HAdV-C2/5, EKC-causing HAdV-D8/37, and progeny formation in human corneal epithelial and cancer cells.
Cdk9	EKC	The study identifies Cdk9 as a postexposure drug target against adenovirus infections in vitro and suggests that the clinically tested anticancer drug flavopiridol is a candidate for treating adenoviral EKC or adenovirus emergence upon immune suppression.
CREB-binding protein	hyperglycemia	We conclude that: 1) synthetic non-thiazolidinediones can serve as ligands of PPARgamma and PPARdelta; 2) ligand-dependent activation of PPARdelta involves an apparent conformational change and association of the receptor ligand binding domain with CREB-binding protein; 3) PPARgamma activation (but not PPARdelta or PPARalpha activation) is sufficient to potentiate preadipocyte differentiation; 4) non-thiazolidinedione PPARgamma agonists improve hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia in vivo; 5) although PPARalpha activation is sufficient to affect triglyceride metabolism, PPARdelta activation does not appear to modulate glucose or triglyceride levels.
pejvakin	AUNA1	At present, four loci associated with non-syndromic auditory neuropathy have been mapped: Autosomal recessive deafness-9 [DFNB9; the otoferlin (OTOF) gene] and autosomal recessive deafness-59 [DFNB59; the pejvakin (PJVK) gene], associated with autosomal recessive inheritance; the autosomal dominant auditory neuropathy gene [AUNA1; the diaphanous-3 (DIAPH3) gene]; and AUNX1, linked to chromosome X.
Fib	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Presence of antibodies to carbamylated fetal calf serum (CarP-FCS) and fibrinogen (CarP-Fib) was determined by inhouse ELISAs among RA cases in the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic (n=846) and in the Swedish Epidemiological Investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (n=1985) cohorts.
FIB	rheumatoid arthritis	To detect the antibodies against human fibrinogen (FIB) Beta67-77 peptide and citrullinated human FIB Beta67-77 peptide in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and examine their diagnostic values in RA.
DR3	myositis	Polymyositis/dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus and Addison's disease, three conditions regulated by the HLA-B8-DR3 haplotype, were most strongly associated with MG, especially early-onset disease.
DR3	myositis	The prevalence of sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) was correlated with the frequency of HLA-DR3.
DR3	myositis	The B8-DR3 haplotype fragment conferred the strongest susceptibility (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.8-4.6), and the B-DR region of other ancestral haplotypes was associated with myositis subgroups.
IFPs	atrophic gastritis	Most gastric IFPs were associated with chronic atrophic gastritis while only one ileal polyp was associated with Meckels diverticulum.
TTC3	Down syndrome	CBR1, DYRK1A, HMGN1, ITSN1, RCAN1, SON, TMEM50B, and TTC3 were each up-regulated two-fold in Down syndrome samples compared to normal samples; of these, SON and TTC3 were newly reported.
TTC3	Down Syndrome	In this report we show that high levels of the TTC3 protein, encoded by one of the genes of the Down Syndrome Critical Region (DCR), prevent neurite extension and disrupt Golgi compactness in differentiating primary neurons.
TTC3	Down syndrome	TTC3 contains a canonical RING finger motif, a pair of tetratricopeptide motifs, a putative Akt phosphorylation site, and nuclear localization signals, and is encoded by a gene within the Down syndrome (DS) critical region on chromosome 21.
TTC3	Down syndrome	Nonchimeric polytransgenic 152F7 mice encompassing four human chromosome 21 genes (DSCR3, DSCR5, TTC3, and DYRK1A) within the Down syndrome critical region present with learning and memory impairment.
VWF	ARDS	Multivariate regression analysis revealed that plasma VWF Ag level is an independent predictor of mortality in ARDS pediatric patients.
VWF	ARDS	Plasma VWF Ag level is an excellent predictive marker for outcome in children with ALI/ARDS.
von Willebrand factor	ARDS	In the multicenter study, patients with direct ARDS also had lower levels of von Willebrand factor antigen and IL-6 and IL-8, markers of endothelial injury and inflammation, respectively.
von Willebrand factor	respiratory failure	To investigate the role of endothelial cell mediators, E-selectin (ES), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), tissue factor (TF), and von Willebrand factor (vWF), in the early phase of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) complicated with respiratory failure [pancreatitis-associated lung injury (PALI)].
CLC-2	primary open-angle glaucoma	Thus, CLC-2 may be a promising and potential novel therapeutic strategy for combating primary open-angle glaucoma.
albumin	type 2 diabetes mellitus	In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression may occur without detectable changes in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate.
PASP	cystic fibrosis	To investigate, for the first time, the impact of systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (PASP) on maximal exercise capacity in adults with mild-to-moderate cystic fibrosis, without PH at rest.
carboxypeptidase B	cystic fibrosis	Assays of carboxypeptidase B-like activity and C3 in serum from patients with cystic fibrosis and appropriate control subjects failed to demonstrate a deficiency of carboxypeptidase B-like activity or a consistent increase in C3, as was suggested by Conover and associates.
carboxypeptidase B	cystic fibrosis	Differences between men and women with cystic fibrosis were apparent, in that women with cystic fibrosis had higher concentrations of both serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity and C3 than either men with cystic fibrosis or control subjects.
carboxypeptidase B	cystic fibrosis	The properties and lysosomal distribution of the enzyme indicated that it was a carboxypeptidase B. Substrate affinity, thermolability, pH stability, the fall and rise in activity with subculture, the cyclical pattern of activity through serial passage and the level of activity were similar for the control and cystic fibrosis enzyme.
selenoproteins	cancer	In this review the roles identified for different selenoproteins in these steps and how they may promote or inhibit metastatic cancers is discussed.
selenoproteins	cancer	Indeed, many selenoproteins have antioxidant activity which can attenuate cancer development by minimizing oxidative insult and resultant DNA damage.
selenoproteins	cancer	In this review, we discuss what is currently known about selenoproteins in tumorigenesis with a focus on their contextual roles in cancer development, growth, and progression.
selenoproteins	cancer	New aspects of Se actions in breast cancer have emerged such as the impact of genetic polymorphisms on Se metabolism and response, new functions of selenoproteins, epigenetic modulation of gene expression, and long-term influence of early-life exposure on disease risk.
SelS	neuroblastoma	We observed that both SelS and C99 were colocalized in the membrane fraction of mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (N2a) cells.
NPY Y1	diabetes	The results suggest that decreased NPY expression in the extended amygdala might be causally linked with the depression induced following type 2 diabetes and that the antidepressant action of imipramine in diabetic mice might be mediated by NPY-NPY Y1 receptor system.
NPY Y1	diabetes	Numerous models of obesity and diabetes are characterized by increased central nervous system (CNS) neuropeptide Y (NPY); in fact, a single intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of NPY in lean fasted rats elevates hepatic VLDL-TG secretion and does so, in large part, via signaling through the CNS NPY Y1 receptor.
annexin A8	pancreatic cancer	We investigated whether annexin A8 (A-A8), a Ca-binding protein overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, plays a role in cell growth and migration and investigated its association with pancreatic cancer prognosis.
ANXA8	pancreatic cancer	Although Annexin A8 (ANXA8), a member of a superfamily of calcium and phospholipid binding proteins, is physiologically expressed in a tissue-specific manner, recent microarray studies reported that ANXA8 was also ectopically expressed in pancreatic cancers.
ANXA8	pancreatic cancer	We investigated the molecular mechanism of expression of ANXA8 in cancer cells and its functional role in pancreatic cancer cells.
annexin A8	ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas	To investigate the utility of 26 immunohistochemical markers (CAM 5.2, CK [cytokeratin] 7, CK20, CK17, CK19, MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC6, p53, DPC4/SMAD4, CDX2, pVHL [von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene protein], S100P, IMP-3 [insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA binding protein 3], maspin, mesothelin, claudin 4, claudin 18, annexin A8, fascin, PSCA [prostate stem cell antigen], MOC31, CEA [carcinoembryonic antigen], and CA19-9 [cancer antigen 19-9]) in the diagnosis of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
annexin A8	pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma	Claudin 18 and annexin A8 are frequently highly overexpressed in infiltrating ductal adenocarcinomas when compared with normal reactive ducts, suggesting a role for these molecules in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.
ROCK1	pediatric osteosarcoma	Multivariate analysis further confirmed that miR-340-low/ROCK1-high expression was an independent prognostic factor of unfavorable survival in pediatric osteosarcoma (for overall survival: p = 0.006, for progression-free survival: p = 0.008).
ROCK1	pediatric osteosarcoma	Our data offer convincing evidence, for the first time, that the combined miR-340 downregulation and ROCK1 upregulation may be linked to tumor progression and adverse prognosis in pediatric osteosarcoma.
3 war	posttraumatic stress disorder	We analyzed the effects of 3 war components-combat exposure (CES), observation of abusive violence (OBS), and participation in abusive violence (PARTC)-and sense of coherence (SOC) on the development of both posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression among a sample of war veterans.
miR-155	breast cancer	The expression levels of miR-155 in 38 pairs of cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from breast cancer patients were detected using quantitative real-time PCR.
miR-155	breast cancer	Soft agar colony formation assay and tumor xenografts showed inhibition of miR-155 could significantly reduce proliferation of cancer cells in vivo and vitro, which confirmed that miR-155 is an effective therapeutic target of breast cancer.
miR-155	breast cancer	Our results underscore the importance of miR-155 as a therapeutic target and combination of Doxorubicinol and miR-155-silencing would be a potential way to cure breast cancer.
miR-155	breast cancer	We have quantified expression of seven oncomiRs, namely miR-17/92 cluster (miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a and miR-20a), miR-21, miR-27a and miR-155, in plasma of 137 breast cancer (BC) patients.
miR-155-5p	breast cancer	Our results suggested that MIAT acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to regulate the expression of dual specificity phosphatase 7 (DUSP7) by taking up miR-155-5p in breast cancer.
miR-155-5p	breast cancer	We conclude that MIAT promotes breast cancer progression and functions as ceRNA to regulate DUSP7 expression by sponging miR-155-5p in breast cancer.
miR-155	breast cancer	Four oncogenic microRNAs (miR-155, miR-19a, miR-181b, and miR-24) and one tumor suppressor microRNA (let-7a) were shown to differentiate between high- and low-risk early breast cancer (EBC) and reflect the surgical tumor removal and adjuvant therapy.
miR-155	breast cancer	The present study determined the role of postoperative wound fluids (WFs) from patients diagnosed with breast cancer subsequent to breast conserving surgery or breast conserving surgery followed by IORT on the expression of three microRNAs (miRNAs), consisting of miR-21, miR-155 and miR-221, in distinct breast cancer cell lines that represent the general subtypes of breast cancer.
miR-155	breast cancer	Additionally, it was indicated that both WFs and RT-WF strongly downregulated the expression of miR-21, miR-155 and miR-221 in basal/epithelial and luminal subtypes of breast cancer.
miR-155	cervical cancer	The expression of three different microRNAs (miR-9, miR-21, and miR-155) in 52 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary cervical cancer tissue samples and 50 FFPE normal cervical tissue samples were evaluated.
miR-155	cervical cancer	MiR-9, miR-21, and miR-155 were significantly overexpressed in cervical cancer tissues compared to normal tissues (P &lt; 0.001).
miR-155	cervical cancer	MiR-21 and miR-155 expression combined with the HPV E6/E7 mRNA assay in HPV E6/E7 negative cervical cancer showed increased AUC of 0.7267 and 0.7000, respectively (P = 0.01, P = 0.04), demonstrating their potential as diagnostic tools.
miR-155	cervical cancer	Moreover, miR-21 and miR-155 were predictors showing a 7 fold and 10.3 fold higher risk for HPV E6/E7 negative patients with cervical cancer (P = 0.024 and P = 0.017, respectively) while miR-155 was a predictor showing a 27.9 fold higher risk for HPV E6/E7 positive patients with cervical cancer (P &lt; 0.0001).
miR-155	cervical cancer	MiR-21 and miR-155 may be helpful in the prediction of both HPV positive and HPV negative cases of cervical cancer.
miR-155	breast cancer	The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinicopathologic significance of expression of EMT-related miRNAs, miR-9 and miR-155, in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs).
miR-155-5p	ovarian cancer	Then, based on the experimentally validated miRNA regulations to target genes, 4 candidate miRNAs (miR-24-3p, miR-192-5p, miR-139-5p and miR-155-5p) were identified to potentially contribute to ovarian cancer cell chemoresistance to CDDP through mediating OVCAR-8R cell CDDP resistance-related gene modules, which participated in functions that were closely related to "apoptosis", "cell cycle" and "adhesion".
distal renal tubular acidosis	interstitial nephritis	The renal involvement may present with symptoms arising from interstitial nephritis, mainly distal renal tubular acidosis.
distal renal tubular acidosis	interstitial nephritis	In a 29-year-old female patient, with bilateral nephrolithiasis, the diagnosis of primary Sjoegren's syndrome, tubulo-interstitial nephritis, distal renal tubular acidosis, and hypokalemia were established.
distal renal tubular acidosis	interstitial nephritis	Tubulo-interstitial nephritis constitutes the most frequent renal lesion and distal tubular acidosis (Type 1) is the most important clinical manifestation of this tubular dysfunction, although the occurrence of chronic renal insufficiency is not an uncommon finding in the presence of distal renal tubular acidosis.
C or S	atrial fibrillation	Right atrial thrombosis is classified as two type: A (mobile, thin) and B (non mobile and attached to atrial wall) that they are probably of cardiac origin due to local pathology, indwelling catheter, atrial fibrillation, stasis, rheumatological or hematological disease like protein C or S deficiency.
C or S	congestive heart failure	Venous stasis (e.g., immobilization, congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, obesity), hypercoagulability (e.g., malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, hyperhomocysteinemia, protein C resistance, antithrombin III, protein C or S deficiency) and endothelial trauma (e.g., surgical trauma, venous trauma, in-dwelling venous instrumentation) are risk factors.
COXI	scleritis	To evaluate the use of selective vs. non-selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (COXIs) for the treatment of chronic non-infectious, non-necrotizing scleritis and episcleritis.
COXI	scleritis	Sixty-nine patients with scleritis and episcleritis treated for &gt;=2 months with COXIs were included.
COXI	scleritis	Initial inflammation control was achieved in 78-81% of scleritis patients and 73-80% episcleritis patients on COXIs (p &gt; .05).
COXI	scleritis	Selective vs. non-selective COXIs were equally efficacious for the treatment of chronic non-infectious, non-necrotizing scleritis and episcleritis.
Dbl	faciogenital dysplasia	Here we show that KIAA0793, containing substantial sequence homology with the catalytic Dbl homology domain of the faciogenital dysplasia gene product (FGD1), is a specific GEF for Cdc42.
Dbl	faciogenital dysplasia	The faciogenital dysplasia gene product, FGD1, is a Dbl family member that has recently been shown to function as a CDC42-specific GEF.
Dbl	faciogenital dysplasia	The majority of proteins that contain a DH (Dbl homology) domain were isolated as oncogenes in transfection assays, but two members of the DH family, FGD1 (the product of the faciogenital dysplasia or Aarskog-Scott syndrome locus) and Vav, have been shown to be essential for normal embryonic development.
Dbl	faciogenital dysplasia	Here we have examined the role of a Dbl-like molecule, the faciogenital dysplasia gene product (FGD1), which when mutated in its Dbl homology domain, cosegregates with the developmental disease Aarskog-Scott syndrome.
PASP	tricuspid regurgitation	Non-survivors (n=29) versus survivors (n=46) were: older (77+/-9.8 vs 68+/-14, p=0.006), had higher New York Heart Association (NYHA) class (2.7+/-0.8 vs 2.3+/-0.8, p=0.037), higher brain natriuretic peptide (1157+/-717 vs 427+/-502 pg/mL, p=0.024, n=18), more coronary artery disease (61% vs 35%, p=0.031), more frequent left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;50% (20.7% vs 4.3%, p=0.026), more functional MR (41% vs 22%, p=0.069), higher mitral E/E(') (12.7+/-4.6 vs 9.8+/-4, p=0.008), higher pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP; 52.6+/-18.7 vs 36.7+/-14, p &lt;0.001), more &gt;=3+ tricuspid regurgitation (28% vs 4%, p=0.005) and more right ventricular dysfunction (26% vs 6%, p=0.035).
PASP	RBBB	The presence of RBBB, IVCD, PASP &gt;= 40 mmHg, left atrium diameter and NYHA functional class were independent predictors of all-cause mortality in DCM patients.
PASP	tricuspid regurgitation	The goals of therapy, which should be highlighted in follow-up imaging, include not only reduction of PASP, decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance, and improvements in right ventricular function, cardiac output, and tricuspid regurgitation.
interferon-gamma	oral squamous cell carcinoma	The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of CD163(+) cells, interleukin-10 (IL-10), and interferon-gamma (IFN-Gamma) in oral lesions associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
interferon-gamma	OSCC	beta-defensin expression was quantitatively assessed using real-time polymerase chain reactions in OSCC and control cell lines after exposure to interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma.
J chain	diffuse large B-cell lymphoma	We investigated the utility of J chain and MEF2B in the diagnosis of CHL, NLPHL, PMBL, T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma (TCRLBL), and B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and CHL (BCLU, DLBCL/CHL) compared to OCT-2 and BOB.1.
J chain	B-cell lymphoma	J chain and MEF2B are highly sensitive and specific markers of NLPHL versus CHL, are particularly useful in highlighting LP cells, and, with rare exception, are of greater utility than OCT-2 and BOB.1 in differentiating CHL from NLPHL and other large B-cell lymphomas.
J chain	cancer	We identified several consensus differentially expressed genes and these genes were further confirmed with literature mining; at last, two genes, that is, immunoglobulin J chain and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 17, were screened as novel gastric cancer associated genes.
IGJ	RR-MS	A discovery/validation study on RR-MS responsive to glatiramer acetate identified 8 differentially expressed genes: ITGA2B, ITGB3, CD177, IGJ, IL5RA, MMP8, P2RY12, and S100Beta.
IGJ	neuroblastoma	For the transcriptome analysis, we found some genes related to Alzheimer's disease (LRP1), an insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF2R), immunity genes (IGL family and IGJ), two genes related to inflammatory reaction (CXCL5 and CCL3), one gene related to maintenance of cellular morphology (NHS), one gene considered to be a strong apoptosis inductor (LGALS14), and several transcripts of the neuroblastoma breakpoint family (NBPF).
J chain	lymphoma	Using principal components analysis, spots containing immunoglobulin J chain, apolipoprotein A-I, procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer-1 and complement C4-A were associated with lymphoma development (P &lt; 0.0001).
lag 3	malaria	The relationship between combined temperature factors showed a linear impact until reaching high temperatures limiting malaria incidence, with a lag 3.25 months.
lymphocyte activation gene-3	malaria	Experimental models of malaria have shown that the regulatory molecules, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte attenuator-4 (CTLA-4), lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), and programmed death-1 (PD-1) are involved in the functional impairment of T cells during infection.
HLA-G 3	Chagas disease	We evaluated the HLA-G 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) polymorphic sites (associated with mRNA stability and target for microRNA binding) and HLA-G tissue expression (heart, colon, and esophagus) in patients presenting Chagas disease, stratified according to the major clinical variants.
HLA-G 3	Chagas disease	Chagas disease patients exhibited differential HLA-G 3'UTR susceptibility allele/genotype/haplotype patterns, according to the major clinical variant (digestive/cardiac/mixed/indeterminate).
Ltb	arthritis	We studied the arthritis association and the spliceo-transcriptome of four different Ltab-Ncr3 haplotypes and showed that higher Ltb and Ncr3 expression, lower Lst1 expression, and the expression of a shorter splice variant of Lst1 correlate with reduced arthritis severity in rats.
Guanine Nucleotide-Binding protein	essential hypertension	The C825T polymorphism (rs5443) of the Guanine Nucleotide-Binding protein subunit Beta3 (GNB3) gene has been associated with obesity, essential hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary diseases, and cerebrovascular events, but with some sex-specific effects.
guanine nucleotide-binding protein	essential hypertension	The guanine nucleotide-binding protein beta polypeptide 3 (GNB3) 825T allele encodes a product that enhances the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins, which is associated with the occurrence of the splice variant GBeta3 s that could play a role in vascular reactivity and hyperproliferation of smooth muscle cells, that makes such proteins attractive candidate gene products for susceptibility to essential hypertension (EH).
guanine nucleotide-binding protein	hypertension	In our investigation of how Ang II signals are converted by the AT1R from physiological to pathological outputs, we found that the purinergic P2Y6 receptor (P2Y6R), an inflammation-inducible G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein)-coupled receptor (GPCR), promoted Ang II-induced hypertension in mice.
guanine nucleotide-binding protein	preeclampsia	We identified the role of regulator of G protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein) signaling 5 (RGS5) in blood pressure regulation during pregnancy and preeclampsia.
NR6A1	prostate cancer	Here, we investigated the expression and function of NR6A1 and its underlying mechanisms in prostate cancer (PCa) patients who underwent radical prostatectomy.
NR6A1	prostate cancer	A total of 303 cases of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy were analysed in a tissue microarray (TMA) for NR6A1 immunohistochemistry-based protein expression.
NR6A1	prostate cancer	Knockdown of NR6A1 by small interfering RNA mediated gene silencing and overexpression of NR6A1 through lentivirus were utilized to investigate its potential role in prostate cancer cells.
NR6A1	prostate cancer	In addition, gene silencing of NR6A1 resulted in G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and decreased metastatic and invasive potential of prostate cancer cells DU145 and PC3.
NR6A1	prostate cancer	In contrast, overexpression of NR6A1 reduced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, and promoted metastatic and invasive potential of prostate cancer cells 22RV1.
RTR	prostate cancer	The increasing age and number of RTR is likely to be paralleled by an increase of prostate cancer (PCa) incidence.
RTR	prostate cancer	We conducted a multicenter retrospective study and reviewed the charts and records of 20 RTRs who had undergone RRP for localized prostate cancer at four French renal transplant centers belonging to the Renal Transplantation Committee of the French Urological Association from April 1996 to April 2007.
RTR	prostate cancer	In our study, RRP was a safe procedure to treat localized prostate cancer in RTRs.
RTR	choriocarcinoma	In this study, we examine the expression of RTR in murine placenta and several human placental choriocarcinoma cell lines.
RTR	choriocarcinoma	RTR mRNA was also expressed in rat choriocarcinoma Rcho-1 cells and in the human placental choriocarcinoma cell lines BeWo, JAR, and JEG-3.
RTR	carcinoma of prostate	To evaluate the prognostic significance of PSA nadir (nPSA) and the time to nadir in disease free of recurrence (DFR) in localized carcinoma of prostate treated with radical radiotherapy (RTR).
Beta-catenin	Pkd1	The present study was aimed to determine the effect of steviol on PC1, CFTR, and Beta-catenin levels in renal epithelial cells with defective PC1 biogenesis and expression (Prkcsh-/- cell) and postnatal Pkd1 homozygous cell (Pkd1-/- cells).
Beta-catenin	Pkd1	Using western blot analysis, it was found that steviol treatment at 100myM for 24-48h substantially enhanced and stabilized PC1 C-terminal expression, while decreasing CFTR and Beta-catenin protein expression in both Prkcsh-/- and Pkd1-/- cells.
Beta-catenin	Pkd1	KPT-9274 can attenuate cellular proliferation and induce apoptosis associated with a decrease in active (phosphorylated) PAK4 and Beta-catenin in several Pkd1-null murine cell lines, with a less pronounced effect on the corresponding phenotypically normal cells.
Beta-catenin	PKD1	Given the fundamental role of Beta-catenin signaling in intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and the growth-promoting function of protein kinase D1 (PKD1) in these cells, we hypothesized that PKDs mediate cross talk with Beta-catenin signaling.
Beta-catenin	PKD1	GPCR stimulation also induced the formation of a complex between PKD1 and Beta-catenin, as shown by coimmunoprecipitation that depended on PKD1 catalytic activation, as it was abrogated by cell treatment with PKD family inhibitors.
Beta-catenin	PKD1	Using transgenic mice that express elevated PKD1 protein in the intestinal epithelium, we detected a marked increase in the localization of Beta-catenin in the nucleus of crypt epithelial cells in the ileum of PKD1 transgenic mice, compared with nontransgenic littermates.
KRT16	Pachyonychia congenita	Pachyonychia congenita subjects were sampled who exhibited a mutation in KRT6A, KRT6B, KRT6C, KRT16 or KRT17, and the proteins were digested and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry.
keratin 16	disease	We thus performed extensive biomarker measures in these compartments using univariate and multivariate approaches to correlate disease biomarkers with SCORAD and with a combined hyperplasia score [thickness and keratin 16 (K16) mRNA] at baseline and after cyclosporine A treatment in 25 moderate to severe AD patients.
kRT16	CRPS	In addition to increased abundance, KRT16 demonstrated autoantigenicity, since sera from both fracture mice and CRPS patients showed increased autoantibody binding to recombinant kRT16 protein.
KRT16	CRPS	The identification of autoantibodies against KRT16 as a biomarker in mice and in humans is a critical step towards these goals, and towards redefining CRPS as having an autoimmune etiology.
Bcl-xL	pancreatitis	These findings were associated with upregulation of mitochondrial Bak and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, proapoptotic and prosurvival members in the Bcl-2 family, respectively, as well as increased mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis in pancreatitis in PKCEpsilon knockout mice.
4CIN	hypoglycemia	We then microinjected a GABAA receptor antagonist, an inhibitor of lactate transport (4CIN), or an inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase, oxamate (OX), into the VMH prior to inducing hypoglycemia.
4CIN	hypoglycemia	To assess whether lactate contributes to raising GABA in RH and diabetes, we injected 4CIN or OX into the VMH of RH and diabetic rats before inducing hypoglycemia.
Bcl-X	pancreatitis	Mechanistically, we show that the protective effect of IL-22 on pancreatitis was mediated via the induction of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), which bind to Beclin-1 and subsequently inhibit autophagosome formation to ameliorate pancreatitis.
MYL4	cardiomyopathy	We used genetically modified rat models to investigate the role of MYL4 in atrial cardiomyopathy.
MYL4	cardiomyopathy	Exome sequencing and systematic bioinformatic analyses identified a rare missense variant of MYL4 (c.31G&gt;A [p.E11K]) in a large multiplex atrial cardiomyopathy family pedigree.
MYL4	cardiomyopathy	MYL4 knockout rats showed a similar atrial cardiomyopathy phenotype, whereas rats with an adjacent 4-amino-acid deletion showed no phenotype.
MYL4	cardiomyopathy	Loss-of-function MYL4 gene variants cause progressive atrial cardiomyopathy in humans and rats.
MYL4	atrial fibrillation	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have yielded variants at &gt;30 loci that associate with atrial fibrillation (AF), including rare coding mutations in the sarcomere genes MYH6 and MYL4.
MYL4	atrial fibrillation	We imputed these variants into 104,220 individuals down to a minor allele frequency of 0.1% and found a recessive frameshift mutation in MYL4 that causes early-onset atrial fibrillation, several mutations in ABCB4 that increase risk of liver diseases and an intronic variant in GNAS associating with increased thyroid-stimulating hormone levels when maternally inherited.
NDUFV2	hypertrophic cardiomyopathy	The aim of this study is to examine the mitochondrial targeting of NDUFV2 and dissect the pathogenetic mechanism of one human deletion mutation present in patients with early-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and encephalopathy.
NDUFV2	hypertrophic cardiomyopathy	The deletion mutant mimicking the human early-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and encephalopathy lacked 19-40 residues in NDUFV2 and exhibited a significant reduction in its mitochondrial targeting ability.
NDUFV2	hypertrophic cardiomyopathy	The results of human disease cell model established that the impairment of mitochondrial localization of NDUFV2 as a mechanistic basis for early-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and encephalopathy.
NDUFV2	hypertrophic cardiomyopathy	A small deletion in the second intron of human NDUFV2 (IVS2+5_+8delGTAA) has been shown to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and encephalomyopathy [Benit, P., Beugnot, R., Chretien, D., Giurgea, I., de Lonlay-Debeney, P., Issartel, J.P., Kerscher, S., Rustin, P., Roetig, A.
NDUFV2	cardiomyopathy	While mutations in the NDUFS3 gene thus result in Leigh syndrome, a dissimilar clinical phenotype is observed in mutations in the NDUFV2 and NDUFS2 genes, resulting in encephalomyopathy and cardiomyopathy.
NDUFV2	hypertrophic cardiomyopathy	Combination of denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and sequence analysis allowed us to show that a 4-bp deletion in intron 2 (IVS2+5_+8delGTAA) of the NDUFV2 gene (encoding NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein 2) causes complex I deficiency and early onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with trunk hypotonia in three affected sibs of a consanguineous family.
NDUFV2	cardiomyopathy	While mutation in a number of genes encoding complex I subunits essentially result in neurological symptoms, this first mutation in NDUFV2 is strikingly associated with cardiomyopathy, as previously observed in the unique case of NDFUS2 mutations.
GALP	obesity	Mice were fed a high fat diet to cause diet-induced obesity (DIO) and then administered GALP intranasally for 2 weeks (experimental), or vehicle (control).
GALP	obesity	GAL and GALP concentrations may be taken as potential biomarkers to predict development of obesity.
GALP	obesity	Galanin-like peptide (GALP) has an anti-obesity effect in rats and mice.
GALP	obesity	These results suggest that intranasal administration is an effective route whereby GALP can exert its effect as an anti-obesity drug.
GALP	obesity	These results show that GALP stimulates fatty acid Beta-oxidation in liver and lipolysis in adipose tissue, and suggest that the anti-obesity effect of GALP may be due to anorexigenic actions and improvement of lipid metabolism in peripheral tissues via the sympathetic nervous system.
GALP	obesity	We conclude that GALP may be of therapeutic value for obesity and life-style-related diseases in the near future.
GALP	obesity	Galanin-like peptide (GALP) shows potential as a therapeutic in the treatment of obesity and related conditions.
SHP-2	gastric atrophy	Variations within the gene locus encoding SHP-2 have been associated with increased susceptibility to develop ulcerative colitis and gastric atrophy.
PTPN11	atrophic gastritis	When we considered the host genetic effects alone, gene-gene interactions consistently decreased the risks of gastric cancer and/or atrophic gastritis, including three two-way interactions: PGC rs6912200-PTPN11 rs12229892, PGC rs4711690-IL1B rs1143623 and PTPN11 rs12229892-IL1B rs1143623 and a three-way interaction: PGC rs4711690-PGC rs6912200-PTPN11 rs12229892.
PTPN11	gastric atrophy	Inconsistency of reported associations of the G/A polymorphism (rs2301756) in the PTPN11 gene and gastric atrophy prompted us to undertake a meta-analysis.
PTPN11	gastric atrophy	Associations of PTPN11 polymorphism with gastric atrophy in H. pylori (-) and (+) subjects are more readily interpreted in the homozygous and recessive models given that the dominant codominant effects skirted null associations.
PTPN11	gastric atrophy	Evidence of overall and subgroup decreased risks, strong in seropositive subjects, demonstrates protective effects of the PTPN11 G/A polymorphism from gastric atrophy.
SHP-2	gastric atrophy	The interaction between Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-2) of gastric epithelial cells and cagA from H. pylori plays a crucial role in developments of gastric atrophy and gastric cancer.
PTPN11	gastric atrophy	This study aimed to investigate the association of haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs) in the PTPN11 gene encoding SHP-2 with gastric atrophy and gastric cancer in Chinese population.
PTPN11	gastric atrophy	Our study provides the first evidence that rs12423190 polymorphism of the PTPN11 gene is significantly associated with an increased risk of gastric atrophy in H. pylori infected Chinese Han population, suggesting that rs12423190 polymorphism could be used as a useful marker of genetic susceptibility to gastric atrophy among H. pylori infected subjects.
integrin-Beta1	colon cancer	The present study indicated that overexpression of GRP78 in colon cancer cells could promote cell-matrix adhesion through the upregulation of fibronectin, integrin-Beta1 and phosphorylated FAK.
integrin Beta1	colon cancer	Collectively, our results suggest that berberine-induced AMPK activation inhibits the metastatic potential of colon cancer cells by decreasing integrin Beta1 protein levels and downstream signaling.
IRF7	hepatitis	On multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of gene expression were hepatitis C (Mx1, OAS2, PKR and IFI16), donor age (IFI16) and recipient gender (IRF7A) (P &lt; .05 for all).
ERRbeta	endometrial carcinoma	No significant difference was observed in the expression of ERRbeta mRNA between endometrial carcinoma (23%, 0.21 +/- 0.16) and normal endometrium (22%, 0.27 +/- 0.15; P &gt; 0.05).
LEB	aortic aneurysm	Patients undergoing major open vascular surgery (open abdominal aortic aneurysm [oAAA] repair, aortofemoral bypass, and lower extremity infrainguinal bypass [LEB]) were identified using the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative (MSQC) between July 2012 and June 2015.
LEB	aortic aneurysm	Beta blocker utilization (&lt;1 month preoperative versus chronic) and POMI rates were prospectively collected for patients undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair (n = 926) and lower extremity bypass (LEB; n = 2,123) from 2003 through 2008.
LEB	aortic aneurysm	We studied 10,081 patients who underwent nonemergent carotid endarterectomy (CEA; n = 5293), lower extremity bypass (LEB; n = 2673), endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR; n = 1005), and open infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (OAAA; n = 1,110) within the VSGNE from 2003 to 2008.
LEB	ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm	We mailed a survey to the directors of the 8 Canadian vascular surgery training programs, to ascertain the yearly operative volumes of their 3 most recent trainees with respect to 6 index operations: carotid endarterectomy (CEA), types I-IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAA) repair, elective open infrarenal aortic aneurysm (eAAA) repair, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) repair, endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) and lower extremity arterial bypass (LEB).
LEB	rAAA	Between 1999 and 2002, vascular surgery trainees in Canadian training programs were exposed to the following yearly clinical volumes (expressed as mean [and standard deviation]): CEA 55.4 (33.9), TAA 6.2 (3.8), eAAA 63.8 (30.0), rAAA 13.5 (9.4), EVAR 14.9 (9.6) and LEB 74.5 (34.5).
LEB	rAAA	The range of yearly clinical volumes were: CEA 21-124, TAA 1-18, eAAA 30-133, rAAA 3-45, EVAR 0-34 and LEB 20-143.
LEB	aortic aneurysm	Risk-adjustment models have not been developed for elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (AAA), lower extremity bypass revascularization (LEB), or lower extremity amputation (AMP).
TrkA	ileus	Postoperative ileus is accompanied by activation of CGRP, NGF-TrkA, and PAR-2 in DRGs.
TrkA	colitis	The present study by examining the mRNA and/or protein levels of TrkA and TrkB in the distal colon and in colonic primary afferent neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) during colitis demonstrated that colitis elicited location-specific changes in the mRNA and protein levels of TrkA and TrkB in colonic primary sensory pathways.
TrkA	colitis	In colitis both the TrkA and TrkB protein levels were increased in the L1 and S1 DRGs in a time-dependent manner; however, the level of TrkB mRNA but not TrkA mRNA was increased in these DRGs.
TrkA	colitis	Further experiments showed that colitis facilitated a retrograde transport of TrkA protein toward and an anterograde transport of TrkA mRNA away from the DRG, which may contribute to the increased TrkA mRNA level in the distal colon during colitis.
TrkA	colitis	Double staining showed that the expression of TrkA but not TrkB was increased in the specifically labeled colonic afferent neurons in the L1 and S1 DRGs during colitis; this increase in TrkA level was attenuated by pretreatment with resiniferatoxin.
TrkA	colitis	These results suggested that colitis-induced primary afferent activation involved retrograde transport of TrkA but not TrkB from the distal colon to primary afferent neurons in DRG.
NTRK1	Hirschsprung's disease	In fact, receptor rearrangements or point mutations convert RET and NTRK1 in dominantly acting transforming genes leading to thyroid tumors, whereas inactivating mutations, associated with Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) and congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), impair RET and NTRK1 functions, respectively.
CCR1	Chagas disease	Thus, our results corroborate that therapeutic strategies based on the modulation of CCR1/CCR5-mediated cell migration and/or effector function may contribute to cardiac tissue damage limitation during chronic Chagas disease.
ITGB2	rheumatoid arthritis	The results of integrated analysis explored 3 OA-related pathways (rheumatoid arthritis, osteoclast differentiation and ECM-receptor interaction) and 4 candidate genes of OA (BST2, HDAC4, ITGB2 and VCAM1) that may be therapeutic targets.
ITGB2	systemic lupus erythematosus	The patient showed moderate expression of CD18 in neutrophils with a homozygous splice mutation with c.41_c.58+2dup20 of ITGB2 and experienced recurrent severe infections complicated with systemic lupus erythematosus.
ITGB2	systemic lupus erythematosus	She received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a matched elder brother with heterozygous mutation of ITGB2, and has since remained free of infection and systemic lupus erythematosus symptoms without immunosuppression therapy.
CD18	arthritis	Using mice deficient in all beta2 integrins (CD18 null mice), we demonstrate that expression of these heterodimeric adhesion molecules is critical for arthritis induction in the K/B x N serum transfer model.
CD18	arthritis	Using null-allele mice and blocking mAbs, we demonstrate specifically that CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1) is absolutely required for the development of arthritis in this model.
amyloid-Beta precursor protein	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	Thus, key proteins in Alzheimer Disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), including amyloid-Beta precursor protein, Tau and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), spread to adjacent cells in their misfolded aggregated forms and exhibit template-directed misfolding to induce further misfolding, disruptions to proteostasis and toxicity.
APP	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	The method is useful for identifying the defective APP-mRNA isoform in LND patients, and in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders in which the APP gene is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases such as autism, fragile X syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease, and may pave the way for new strategies applicable to rational antisense drugs design.
APP	motor neuron disease	Several findings suggest that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the amyloid cascade may play a role in motor neuron disease (MND).
APP	amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	Considering that dementia is one of the most frequent non-motor symptoms in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and that hippocampus is one of the brain areas with greater presence of amyloid-related changes in neurodegenerative diseases, our aim was to analyze the molecular markers of the amyloid cascade of APP in pathology studies of the hippocampus of autopsied patients with ALS and ALS-frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
ABeta	ALS-FTD	Immunohistochemical studies and confocal microscopy were used to analyze the expression of APP, TDP-43, pho-TDP-43, ABeta, APP intracellular cytoplasmatic domain (AICD) peptide, Fe65 protein, and pho-TAU in the hippocampus of seven patients with ALS, two patients with ALS-FTD, and four controls.
Sidt2	fatty liver disease	These results suggest that Sidt2(-/-) mice had spontaneous nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) accompanied by ERS.
Sidt2	glucose intolerance	Intraperitoneal and oral glucose tolerance tests in Sidt2 knockout mice indicated glucose intolerance and decreased serum insulin level.
CDH7	bipolar disease	For example, CDH15 and PCDH19 are associated with cognitive impairment; CDH5, CDH8, CDH9, CDH10, CDH13, CDH15, PCDH10, PCDH19 and PCDHb4 with autism; CDH7, CDH12, CDH18, PCDH12 and FAT with bipolar disease and schizophrenia; and CDH11, CDH12 and CDH13 with methamphetamine and alcohol dependency.
UCN	cancer	The UCNs emitting UV/blue and green/red multiband light were used to activate the photoresponsive Azo and photosensitizer RB molecules; The mesoporous silica shell offered the possibilities to load anticancer drug and conjugate the light triggers; As there are strong charge interaction and hydrogen bonds between Dox and surface silanols of mesoporous silica, the azobenzene molecules worked as "gatekeeper" and "molecular stirrer" to precisely trap and propel the release of Dox under the external stimuli.
UCN	endometrial adenocarcinoma	UCN1 is significantly reduced in endometrial adenocarcinoma compared to healthy controls.
UCN	cancer	UCN1 suppressed migration of endometrial cancer cells in vitro.
UCN	cancer	We demonstrate that UCN1 significantly suppresses the migration of endometrial cancer cells but has no effect on their proliferation.
UCN	cancer	Thus, loss of UCN1 in endometrial cancer may promote invasion and metastatic spread.
UCN	NSHL	Seven pathogenic variants leading to NSHL have so far been reported on two mitochondrial genes: MT-RNR1 encoding 12SrRNA and MT-TS1 encoding tRNA for Ser((UCN)) .
FcgammaRIIB	allergic rhinitis	This study examines the role of FcgammaRIIB in the initiation of allergic rhinitis in mice.
FcgammaRIIB	allergic rhinitis	These results suggest that FcgammaRIIB plays a regulatory role in the initiation of allergic rhinitis that is independent of either mouse strain or type of sensitization.
RFK	myeloma	This study evaluated the interaction of radiation therapy (RT) and radiofrequency kyphoplasty (RFK) in the treatment of myeloma associated VCF.
RFK	myeloma	Eighty-six myeloma patients with VCF were treated with RFK followed by radiation therapy (RFK group) or vice versa (RT group).
RFK	myeloma	RFK is an effective method for treating VCF in myeloma patients independent of treatment order with regard to radiation therapy.
RFK	prostate cancer	We investigated the involvement of RFK in cisplatin resistance using human prostate cancer PC3 cells.
RFK	prostate cancer	The present study suggests that RFK expression is involved not only in cellular protection from oxidative stress but also in malignant progression of prostate cancer.
plasminogen	cancer	The anti-cancer effect of ATF-Fc (alone and in combination with trastuzumab) on tumor cells and in a nude mouse tumor model was evaluated by detecting the expression of uPA, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and HER-2.
plasminogen	cancer	The ability of HMGA1 to regulate the plasminogen activator system may constitute an important mechanism by which HMGA1 promotes cancer progression.
KCNJ1	diabetes	KCNJ1 variation is associated with multiple diseases, such as antenatal Bartter syndrome and diabetes.
Kir1.1	diabetes mellitus	Neither diabetes mellitus nor Tempol altered Kir1.1, Kir2.1, Kir6.1, or SUR2B protein levels in renal cortical microvessels.
Kir1.1	diabetes mellitus	To the extent that the effects of Tempol reflect its antioxidant actions, our observations indicate that oxidative stress contributes to the exaggerated impact of Kir1.1, Kir2.1, and K(ATP) channels on afferent arteriolar tone during diabetes mellitus and that this phenomenon involves posttranslational modulation of channel function.
TRPV1	asthma	Furthermore, results suggested that co-exposure exacerbated the activation of TRPV1 signal pathways, with an enhancement in substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide production, which contributed to inflammation in asthma by neurogenic inflammation.
TRPV1	asthma	It is concluded that co-exposure to PM2.5 and FA exacerbated allergic asthma through oxidative stress and enhanced TRPV1 activation.
TRPV1	asthma	In this review we will summarize recent evidence for an involvement of TRP channels (TRPA1, TRPC4, TRPC6, TRPV1, TRPV4, TRPM2 and TRPM8) expressed in the lung in pathways of toxin sensing and as mediators of lung inflammation and associated diseases like asthma, COPD, lung fibrosis and edema formation.
TRPV1	asthma	Our purpose was to investigate the regulatory mechanism of TRPV1 and related cytokines on children bronchial asthma.
TRPV1	asthma	Logistic regression analysis further demonstrated that TRPV1 mRNA level, EOS, IL-4 and IL-5 may be risk factors for children bronchial asthma.

TRPV1	asthma	oleoylethanolamide, sphingosine-1-phosphate, N-palmitoyltaurine) were postulated to be involved in activating the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) receptor, driving TRPV1-dependent pathogenesis in asthma.Our findings suggest that asthma is characterised by a modest systemic metabolic shift in a disease severity-dependent manner, and that steroid treatment significantly affects metabolism.
TRPV1	asthma	To investigate the effects of particulate matter &lt;= 2.5 microns (PM2.5) on asthma-related phenotypes and on lung expression of TRPA1 and TRPV1 proteins in a mouse model of asthma.
TRPV1	asthma	PM2.5 exacerbates effects of asthma in this model, possibly by regulating TRPA1 and TRPV1 and the relevant neurokines.
Tln2	cardiomyopathy	Our results show that CM Tln2 is essential for proper Beta1D-integrin expression and that Tln1 can substitute for Tln2 in preserving heart function, but that loss of all Tln forms from the heart-muscle cell leads to myocyte instability and a dilated cardiomyopathy.
hsa-miR-221-5p	Cancer	The levels of two miRNAs, hsa-miR-132-5p and hsa-miR-221-5p, were inversely correlated with the expression of CYP1A2 mRNA transcripts in normal human liver tissue samples represented in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.
miR-221-5p	cancer	In situ hybridization and functional experiments in a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines and xenografts further clarified the role of clinical relevant miRNAs.Results: Six miRNAs (miR-92b-3p, miR-188-3p, miR-221-5p, miR-331-3p, miR-425-3p, and miR-497-5p) were identified as strong predictors of survival in the screening cohort.
Pt	CLN2	Particularly, CLN1, CLN2 and CLN3 were obtained by adding derivatives C1, C2 or C3 during nanoparticles preparation, while CLN2-Pt were obtained by treating preformed CLN2 with Pt(II).
Pt	CLN2	As determined by ICP-OES, a content of P and Pt 2.2-fold and 2.5-fold higher in CLN2-Pt than in CLN3 was evidenced.
Pt	CLN2	In fact, the antiproliferative activity shown by CLN3, CLN2-Pt on the three model cancer cell lines was substantially similar and comparable to that of complex C3 in dmso solution.

WT-1	GIST	Pathologic diagnosis of CD117-negative GISTs can be facilitated with the application of a panel of immunohistochemical markers, including DOG-1 and WT-1.
WT-1	GIST	In this study, WT-1 immunoreactivity was explored in 97 gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs).
WT-1	GIST	The expression of WT-1 was compared with other immunohistochemical markers of GIST and the association with clinicopathological features was also evaluated.
WT-1	GIST	All 97 GISTs were positive for WT-1 and the staining intensity was strong in 59 (60.8%), moderate in 28 (28.9%) and weak in 10 cases (10.3%).
WT-1	GIST	Although the biological roles of WT-1 in GIST are still unknown, our findings might provide a rationale for immunotherapy targeting WT-1 and a therapeutic solution to the challenge of imatinib-resistant GISTs.
WT-1	GIST	WT-1 immunoreactivity in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) was currently not known.
WT-1	GIST	We, therefore, investigated the expression of WT-1 in GIST in comparison to other soft tissue tumors by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis.
WT-1	GIST	We found that all 28 cases (100%) of GIST are positive for WT-1, diffusely (&gt;75%, 3+) in 13 (46.4%) cases, moderately (26% to 75%, 2+) in 13 (46.4%) cases, and focally (5% to 25%, 1+) in 2 (7.2%) cases.
WT-1	GIST	The significance of cytoplasmic expression of WT-1 in GIST and some smooth muscle tumors is unclear and warrant further investigation.

MAP4	prostate cancer	Based on these data, we proposed the set of potential biomarkers for detection of prostate cancer and discrimination between prostate tumors with different malignancy and aggressiveness: BHLHE40, FOXP1, LOC285205, ITGA9, CTDSPL, FGF12, LOC440944/SETD5, VHL, CLCN2, OSBPL10/ZNF860, LMCD1, FAM19A4, CAND2, MAP4, KY, and LRRC58.
MAP4	cancer	We also analyzed gene expression of MAP4 in 34 patients with bladder cancer using immunohistochemical staining assay.
MAP4	cancer	We used cAMP elevators and small interfering RNA of MAP4 here, found that both of them can potently inhibit the invasion and the migration of bladder cancer cells by disrupting microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton.
MAP4	cancer	Consistently, the bladder cancer grade is positively correlated with the protein level of MAP4.
MAP4	cancer	Our results indicated that the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway might inhibit bladder cancer cell invasion by targeting MAP4-dependent microtubule dynamics, which could be exploited for the therapy of invasive bladder cancer.
FOS	Irritable bowel syndrome	Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms consistently improved after 3 weeks of LFD, and significantly more participants reported symptom relief in response to placebo (80%) than FOS (30%).
TEF	pneumonia	Children with congenital esophageal atresia (EA) and tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) have chronic respiratory symptoms including recurrent pneumonia, wheezing and persistent cough.
TEF	pneumonia	Adult patients experiencing symptoms of cough and recurrent aspiration pneumonia should be evaluated for congenital TEF.
TEF	pneumonia	Our patient underwent primary repair of OA/TEF malformations, which was later complicated by pneumonia and a recurrent TEF.
IL-15	pneumonia	These findings suggest that a relatively small increase in plasma TNF-Alfa, and decreases in urine TNF-Alfa, GM-CSF, and IL-15 from just before to just after the diagnosis of pneumonia could be markers for an increased risk of PUs in individuals with pneumonia after traumatic SCI.
IL-15	bronchiolitis	The study aimed to investigate the innate cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15) as a marker of disease severity.A prospective single-centre observational study was conducted in a university-affiliated paediatric teaching hospital, comparing children (0-18 months) hospitalised for viral bronchiolitis, those admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit with severe disease and healthy age-matched controls.
IL-15	bronchiolitis	Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) IL-15 mRNA expression was significantly higher in those with moderate severity bronchiolitis compared with controls and those with severe disease.
IL-15	bronchiolitis	Targets of de-regulated miRNA were differentially expressed in bronchiolitis, including JAK3, STAT5A and NFKB1 on the IL-15 signalling pathway.IL-15 is associated with disease severity in children hospitalised with viral bronchiolitis.

SWA	epilepsy	Patients with SWA were older at seizure diagnosis than those with SA (p=0.04), were less often referred for evaluation of seizures or epilepsy (p=0.04), and were referred faster for VEM, despite SWA were significantly less likely to include motor manifestations (p=0.0004).
SWA	epilepsy	We suggest that patients with SWA have a unique epilepsy syndrome.
SWA	epilepsy	Achilles tendon (T) and Hoffmann (H) reflexes were evoked during spike and wave activity (SWA) in 6 patients with generalized epilepsy, selected on the basis of their photosensitivity.
SWA	epilepsy	Partial epilepsy after shunting manifested itself in 15 patients, but this did not correlate with the side of the shunt or with the side of the SWA in the EEG.
NDI	hypokalemia	We hypothesized that the NDI may be due to of severe hypokalemia induced tubular dysfunction.
V2R	metabolic acidosis	Previously, we reported an increase of V1aR mRNA and a decrease of V2R mRNA in the collecting ducts under chronic metabolic acidosis.
OBF	severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy	Patients with moderate to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) had POBF 18% higher than the control (mean OBF, 943 microL/min).
OBF	severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy	Among PRP-treated subjects with PDR, ocular blood flow was 22% below the control (mean OBF, 619 microL/min), and 34% less than moderate to severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy.
OBF	NPDR	Diabetic patients with no retinopathy or mild NPDR had OBF indistinguishable from the control (785 vs. 797 microL/min).
OBF	severe NPDR	POBF is unaffected early in diabetic retinopathy, but increases significantly in eyes with moderate to severe NPDR.
OBF	NPDR	These experimental data represent the largest published assessment of POBF in NPDR.
OBF	age related macular degeneration	POBF in the patients with non-exudative and exudative age related macular degeneration (AMD) was investigated.
OBF	NPDR	The POBF increased but was still below normal levels at the NPDR stage, and then increased to an above normal level in the PPDR/PDR stage of diabetic retinopathy.

GNG2	melanoma	Our recent study showed reduced G protein Gamma2 subunit (Gng2/GNG2) expression levels in malignant melanoma cells compared with those in benign melanocytic cells in both mice and humans.
GNG2	melanoma	Our recent study also showed that reduced GNG2 alone augmented proliferation of malignant melanoma cells.
GNG2	melanoma	To our knowledge, however, there is no evidence showing an effect of Gng2/GNG2 alone on metastasis of any cancers including malignant melanoma.
GNG2	melanoma	In his study, we first prepared GNG2-overexpressed SK-Mel28 human malignant melanoma cells, in which GNG2 protein expression level was undetectably low.
GNG2	melanoma	Migration and invasion activities of the GNG2-overexpressed malignant melanoma cells were suppressed up to 1/10th, with decreased activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK).
GNG2	melanoma	Taken together, our results suggest that overexpression of GNG2 alone inhibits metastasis in human malignant melanoma cells with decreased FAK activity.
GNG2	melanoma	Thus, GNG2 might be a candidate of molecular targets of prevention and therapy for metastasis of malignant melanoma.
GNG2	melanoma	Our recent study showed reduced G protein Gamma2 subunit (Gng2/GNG2) expression levels in malignant melanoma cells compared with those in benign melanocytic cells in both mice and humans.

GNG2	melanoma	The purpose of this study was to examine the biological significance of GNG2 in human malignant melanoma cells.
GNG2	melanoma	Levels of proliferation and activities of signal transduction molecules were examined in both GNG2-overexpressed and -depleted human malignant melanoma cells.
GNG2	melanoma	Proliferation of GNG2-overexpressed SK-Mel28 human malignant melanoma cells was suppressed with decreased c-SRC and AKT activities and increased p21(Cip/WAF1) expression level in vitro.
GNG2	melanoma	In contrast, proliferation of GNG2-depleted A375P human malignant melanoma cells was enhanced with increased c-SRC and AKT activities and decreased p21(Cip/WAF1) expression level in vitro.
GNG2	melanoma	We demonstrated for the first time that increased protein expression level of GNG2 alone inhibits proliferation of malignant melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that GNG2 could be a novel molecular target for malignant melanoma therapy.
Gng2	melanoma	Gng2 transcript expression levels in a malignant melanoma were less than 1/10 of the level in a benign tumor.
Gng2	melanoma	The difference in Gng2 transcript expression levels between benign tumors and malignant melanomas was greatest among all of the G protein Gamma subunits examined in this study.
Gng2	melanoma	Moreover, protein expression levels of Gng2 were decreased in malignant melanomas compared with those in benign melanocytic tumors in RET-mice.
GNG2	melanoma	Analysis of human malignant melanomas also showed reduced GNG2 protein expression levels in five human malignant melanoma cell lines compared with the expression levels in normal human epithelial melanocytes (NHEM).
GNG2	melanoma	Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that Gng2/GNG2 expression levels are reduced in malignant melanoma, suggesting that GNG2 could be a novel biomarker for malignant melanoma.
Gadd45b	stroke	Several DNA repair enzymes are essential for comprehensive neural repair mechanisms after stroke, including PolBeta and NEIL3 for neurogenesis, APE1 for white matter repair, Gadd45b for axonal regeneration, and DNA-PKs for neurovascular remodeling.
TFF3	endometrial cancer	The aims of this study are to determine the expression and the prognostic value of TFF3 in a large series of human endometrial cancer and its relation with ER.
TFF3	endometrial carcinoma	We evaluated 328 endometrial carcinomas using TFF3 and ER antibody on paraffin-embedded tissue.
TFF3	endometrial carcinoma	1-TFF3 seems to be a novel pathway in the pathogenesis of type I endometrial carcinomas.
TFF3	endometrioid carcinoma	2-The strong association of TFF3 and ER in the estrogen-dependent endometrioid carcinoma could explain the reason for its frequent expression by this tumor type.
TFF3	endometrial carcinoma	3-TFF3(+) seems to forecast a good prognosis in type I endometrial carcinomas.
TFF3	endometrial cancer	Based on our data, TFF3 expression in endometrial cancer deserves further investigation.
intestinal trefoil factor	endometrial carcinoma	We evaluated 401 endometrial carcinomas cases by using four immunomarkers - oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), insulin-like growth factor II mRNA - binding protein 3 (IMP3), and intestinal trefoil factor 3 (TFF3)-on a tissue microarray.
TFF3	endometrial carcinoma	We recommend using an ER/PR/TFF3/IMP3 immunohistochemical panel in selected cases of endometrial carcinoma where the differential diagnosis is challenging.
FAM107A	cancer	By RT-PCR we have confirmed complete FAM107A downregulation in laryngeal cancer cell lines (15/15) and primary tumors (21/21) and this finding was further supported by FAM107A protein immunohistochemistry (15/15).
Downregulated in renal cell carcinoma 1	renal cell carcinoma	Downregulated in renal cell carcinoma 1 (DRR1) has important roles in tumor cell growth, neuron survival and spine formation, and was recently shown to bind actin.
DRR1	neuroblastoma	In addition, DRR1 and COMMD1 suppressed the cyclin D1 expression, G1/S transition and cell proliferation of neuroblastoma cells.
DRR1	neuroblastoma	Consistent with these facts, low expressions of DRR1 were associated with tumorigenesis of human neuroblastoma and its mouse model.
DRR1	neuroblastoma	This study has thus revealed a novel nuclear complex of F-actin, DRR1 and COMMD1 that is involved in NF-KB degradation and cell cycle suppression in neuroblastoma cells.
FAM107A	lung cancer	The aim of the present study was to analyze the expression level of FAM107A gene, a TSG located in 3p21.1, in lung cancer tumors and in tumor adjacent normal lung samples.
FAM107A	NSCLC	Promoter methylation of FAM107A gene was confirmed only in the minority of NSCLCs.
Fam107A	renal cell carcinoma	We recently characterized a stress and glucocorticoid-regulated gene, down-regulated in renal cell carcinoma - DRR1 (Fam107A).
FAM107A	cancer	In human, FAM107A termed TU3A/DRR1 has been reported as a candidate tumor suppressor gene which expression is downregulated in several types of cancer, however no studies have investigated the other family protein, FAM107B.
Down-regulated in renal cell carcinoma 1	renal cell carcinoma	Down-regulated in renal cell carcinoma 1 (DRR1) is mapped at 3p21.1, and is a candidate tumor suppressor gene.
DRR1	cancer	DRR1 was poorly expressed in established cancer cell lines, including neuroblastoma cells, whereas strong expression was observed in normal cells.
DRR1	neuroblastoma	A neuroblastoma model, MYCN transgenic mice, revealed that DRR1 protein was expressed in the celiac ganglion 2 weeks after birth when neuroblast hyperplasia was also observed; however, there was no longer any expression of DRR1 protein in tumors originating from the ganglion 8 weeks after birth.
DRR1	neuroblastoma	Together, our data indicate that DRR1 protein is expressed in normal cells, particularly in the nervous system during embryogenesis, is involved in neuronal cell survival, and is downregulated during neuroblastoma carcinogenesis.
TU3A	renal cell carcinoma	TU3A, located on 3p21.1, was originally identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
TU3A	cancer	Recently, down-regulation of TU3A expression has been reported not only in RCC but also in other types of cancers.
TU3A	cancer	Furthermore, we observed promoter hyper-methylation of TU3A in several types of cancer cell lines and primary cancers of the bladder and testis.
TU3A	cancer	To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate the epigenetic inactivation of TU3A in human cancers.
TU3A	cancer	The findings of this study warrant further study to investigate the role of TU3A methylation in cancer development.
TMEM195	gestational diabetes	The aim of this study was to examine the association between GCK, GCKR, FADS1, DGKB/TMEM195 and CDKAL1 gene polymorphisms and the development of gestational diabetes.
SCN1A	Familial hemiplegic migraine	Background Familial hemiplegic migraine type 3 is a monogenic subtype of migraine caused by missense mutations in the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN1A, with 10 different mutations reported so far.
SCN1A	familial hemiplegic migraine	Results In both pedigrees, we identified SCN1A mutation p.F1499L, which has been previously associated with familial hemiplegic migraine type 3 and elicited repetitive daily blindness.
SCN1A	familial hemiplegic migraine	Conclusion Like a substantial proportion of other familial hemiplegic migraine type 3 mutations, p.F1499L affects the intracellular linker between domains III and IV of SCN1A, which seems to be a mutational hot-spot.
SCN1A	familial hemiplegic migraine	A genetic link between these two diseases is particularly evident in familial hemiplegic migraine: mutations of ATP1A2, SCN1A and CACNA1A genes, identified in this disease, have also been involved in different types of epilepsy and febrile seizures.
SCN1A	FHM	Mutations in three genes (CACNA1A, ATP1A2, and SCN1A) have been found to cause FHM.
FHM3	FHM	Among these, nine SCN1A gene mutations were reported to cause familial hemiplegic migraine type 3 (FHM3).
SCN1A	FHM	Method The clinical manifestations of a Chinese FHM family were recorded and all coding exons and flanking intronic regions of the CACNA1A, ATP1A2, and SCN1A genes were tested for mutations.
SCN1A	FHM	Conclusion The identification of a novel mutation in the SCN1A gene in the Chinese population may further aid in the understanding of FHM genetics.
SCN1A	FHM	Mutations in four genes have been identified in familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), from which CACNA1A (FHM type 1) and SCN1A (FHM type 3) code for neuronal voltage-gated calcium or sodium channels, respectively, while ATP1A2 (FHM type 2) encodes the Alfa2 isoform of the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase's catalytic subunit, thus classifying FHM primarily as an ion channel/ion transporter pathology.
SCN1A	FHM	Moreover, three genes (CACNA1A, ATP1A2, and SCN1A) have come from studies performed in individuals with familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), a monogenic form of migraine with aura.
FHM3	FHM	The FHM3 subtype is caused by mutations in SCN1A, which is also the most frequent epilepsy gene encoding the voltage-gated Na+ channel NaV1.1.
FHM3	FHM	The aim of this study was to explore the clinical, genetic and pathogenetic features of a pure FHM3 family.
SCN1A	FHM	Results and conclusions We identified a novel SCN1A (p.Leu1624Pro) mutation in a pure FHM family with notably early-onset attacks at mean age of 7.
FHM3	FHM	L1624P locates in S3 of domain IV, the same domain as two of four known pure FHM3 mutations.
FHM3	FHM	Similar to the known FHM3 mutations, this novel mutation predicts hyperexcitability of GABAergic inhibitory neurons.
SCN1A	migraine with aura	Sixty patients with migraine without aura (MO) or with different types of migraine with aura (MA), including sporadic hemiplegic, familial hemiplegic, and probable familial hemiplegic, were screened for mutations in the four genes previously linked with different types of migraine (ATP1A2, CACNA1A, SCN1A, and KCNK18).
SCN1A	FHM	One novel mutation in SCN1A, encoding Alfa subunit of sodium channel, causing amino acid change M1500V localized to a region encoding inactivation loop between transmembrane domains III and IV of the channel, was detected in a female FHM patient.
SCN1A	FHM	The presence of SCN1A mutations and absence of mutations in ATP1A2 or CACNA1A suggest that the Polish patients represent FHM type 3.
SCN1A	FHM	Mutations of the voltage gated Na(+) channel Na(V)1.1 (SCN1A) are important causes of different genetic epilepsies and can also cause familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM-III).
Nav1.1	FHM	A mutation causing FHM type 3 (FHM3) has been identified in SCN1A encoding the Nav1.1 Na(+) channel.
FHM3	FHM	In particular, we investigate the dynamical repertoire from normal spiking (milliseconds) to spreading depression and anoxic depolarization (tens of seconds) and show that FHM3 mutations render gray matter tissue more vulnerable to spreading depression despite opposing effects associated with action potential generation.
SLPI	gastritis	PAR2 gene expression correlated positively with transcript levels of IL-8, IL-1Beta as well mucosal SLPI levels in H. pylori-infected patients (r: 0.47-0.84; p &lt; .0001), whereas no correlation was found with the degree of gastritis.
SLPI	gastritis	Mucosal levels of Secretory Leukocyte Protease Inhibitor (SLPI) are specifically reduced in relation to H. pylori-induced gastritis.
SLPI	gastritis	In contrast to other diseases, SLPI seems not to have a regulatory role for Progranulin in H. pylori-mediated gastritis.
SLPI	gastritis	SLPI expression is generally induced during inflammation; however, Helicobacter pylori-mediated gastritis is associated with significantly decreased antral SLPI levels.
SLPI	lymphocytic gastritis	SLPI expression was retrospectively analysed by immunohistochemistry in 85 paraffin-embedded samples: H. pylori-induced (n=13), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-enhanced (n=18), autoimmune (n=11), lymphocytic gastritis (n=26) and H. pylori-negative controls (n=17).
SLPI	lymphocytic gastritis	In comparison with the control group, the SLPI expression of antral mucosa in H. pylori-mediated and lymphocytic gastritis was significantly lower (P&lt;0.001), whereas epithelial SLPI expression was not affected in NSAID-enhanced and autoimmune gastritis either in the antrum or corpus, respectively.
SLPI	lymphocytic gastritis	Both the H. pylori-mediated and lymphocytic gastritis revealed a significantly lower expression of SLPI in infiltrating immune cells (P&lt;0.01), whereas immune cells infiltrating the corpus in autoimmune gastritis showed higher SLPI levels than the immune cells of other groups (P&lt;0.03).
SLPI	gastritis	Antral SLPI levels were inversely correlated with inflammatory scores of antrum-predominant gastritis.
Notch-2	renal fibrosis	Pharmacological inhibition of different signaling pathways and genetic knockdown of Notch-2 further revealed JNK as an upstream effector of Notch-2 in TGF-Beta1-mediated renal fibrosis.
Notch-2	ureteral obstruction	Consistently, we also demonstrated that administration of TSA or a Gamma-secretase inhibitor RO4929097 in the mouse model of unilateral ureteral obstruction significantly ameliorated renal fibrosis through suppression of the JNK/Notch-2 signaling activation.
HJCYS	ESRD	Although, renal abnormalities are considered an integral part of the HJCYS, published reports on ESRD are scarce.
Notch2	nephrosis	Here we show that Notch2 prevents podocyte loss and nephrosis.
Notch2	focal segmental glomerulosclerosis	Administration of a Notch2 agonistic monoclonal antibody ameliorates proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in a mouse model of nephrosis and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.
Notch2	nephrosis	Hence, specific activation of Notch2 rescues damaged podocytes and activating Notch2 may represent a novel clinical strategy for the amelioration of nephrosis and glomerulosclerosis.
Notch2	nephropathy	To investigate the effect of both fermented Cordyceps powder (CS) and prednisone on the Notch2/hes-1 signaling activation in the kidney tubules of rats with acute aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAAN).
NOTCH2	renal tubular acidosis	The role of NOTCH2 and JAG1 in formation of proximal nephron structures and podocytes might explain the observed phenotypes of renal dysplasia and proteinuria in patients with Alagille syndrome, and renal tubular acidosis may be the result of JAG1 expression in the collecting ducts.
EC 4.2.1.1	dental caries	The oral pathogenic bacterium involved in human dental caries formation Streptococcus mutans, encodes for two carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) one belonging to the Alfa- and the other one to the Beta-class.
EC 4.2.1.1	dental caries	Streptococcus mutans, the oral pathogenic bacterium provoking dental caries formation, encodes for a Beta-class carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1), SmuCA.
EC 4.2.1.1	periodontitis	A carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) denominated PgiCA, belonging to the Gamma-class, from the oral pathogenic bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis, the main causative agent of periodontitis, was investigated for its inhibition profile with sulfonamides and one sulfamate.
FIR	XPB	Recently, an interaction between FIR (FUSE-Binding Protein-Interacting Repressor) and TFIIH/p89/XPB helicase was found to repress c-myc transcription and so might be important for suppressing tumor formation.
FIR	XPB	In XPB cells carrying mutant TFIIH, loop formation failed and the serum response was abnormal; RNAi depletion of FIR similarly disabled c-myc regulation.
FIR	XPB	Recently, an interaction between FUSE-binding protein-interacting repressor (FIR) and TFIIH/p89/XPB helicase was found to repress c-myc transcription and might be important for suppressing tumor formation.
FIR	XPB	Here, XPB and XPD mutations are shown to block transcription activation by the FUSE Binding Protein (FBP), a regulator of c-myc expression, and repression by the FBP Interacting Repressor (FIR).
FIR	XPB	The repression domain of FIR targeted only TFIIH's p89/XPB helicase, required at several stages in transcription, but not factors required for promoter selection.
IL-32	psoriasis	To investigate the tissue expression and systemic levels of IL-32, as well as its cellular sources, in patients with HS in comparison with healthy donors and patients with two other inflammatory skin diseases: psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD).
IL-32	psoriasis	IL-32 was upregulated in patients with HS in both lesional skin and serum when compared with healthy donors and patients with AD or psoriasis.
IL32	psoriasis	Using skin samples from patients with mycosis fungoides (n = 21), healthy volunteers (n = 17), and individuals with atopic dermatitis (n = 17) and psoriasis (n = 9), we found IL32 mRNA expression significantly higher in mycosis fungoides samples than in samples from benign inflammatory skin diseases, and its expression increases with disease progression.
IL-32	psoriasis	Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that IL-32 was expressed in AD lesional skin, whereas it was present in neither skin biopsy specimens from healthy donors nor in lesional skin from patients with psoriasis.
ASPP2	choriocarcinoma	In this study, the expression profile of ASPP2 in choriocarcinoma was examined in comparison with normal placentas and hydatidiform moles, the latter being a type of GTD that carries malignant potential.
ASPP2	choriocarcinoma	Downregulation of ASPP2 messenger RNA and protein was demonstrated in choriocarcinoma by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry.
ASPP2	choriocarcinoma	ASPP2-transfected choriocarcinoma cells (JEG-3 and JAR) showed an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in cell migration as detected by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and wound healing assays, respectively, illustrating the complex action of ASPP2 on cell functions other than programmed cell death.
ASPP2	choriocarcinoma	Taken together, we demonstrated a loss of tumor-suppressive ASPP2 in choriocarcinoma with effects on cell migration and apoptosis.
ETK	ESRD	No correlation between erythrocyte TDP concentration and transketolase activity and/or alpha-ETK was observed in ESRD patients, either before or 10 h after administration.
PAI-1	chondropathy	Scores for VEGF, TIMP-1, TIMP-3, SLPI and PAI-1 were all increased in OA compared with PM, and higher scores were associated with greater chondropathy.
PAI-1	arthropathy	Concentrations of the plasminogen activators pro-urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitors 1 and 2 (PAI-1 and PAI-2), plasminogen, and fibrin split product D-dimer in synovial fluid (SF) and blood plasma of 29 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were compared with the concentrations of 18 patients with spondyloarthropathy (SpA).
MPO	ALs	Besides myeloperoxidase (MPO), which was used as the gold standard in differentiating AML from other type of ALs, the most specific markers for AML in our study were CD14 and CD64 (99.5 and 95.6%).
MPO	facial palsy	They were characterized as follows: (1) disease onset with initial signs/symptoms due to intractable otitis media with effusion or granulation, which did not respond to ordinary treatments such as antibiotics and insertion of tympanic ventilation tubes, followed by progressive hearing loss; (2) predominantly female (73%) and older (median age: 68 years); (3) predominantly myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA-positive (60%), followed by proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA-positive (19%) and both ANCAs-negative (16%); (4) frequently observed accompanying facial palsy (36%) and hypertrophic pachymeningitis (28%); and (5) disease often involving lung (35%) and kidney (26%) lesions.
JFK	Parkinson Disease	Effects of zolpidem were wide ranging (eg, improvement on the JFK Coma Recovery Scale-Revised, the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, and the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale) and generally lasted 1 to 4 hours before the participant returned to baseline.
HSD3B2	endometriosis	The altered tissue steroid concentrations in endometriosis were in line with the expression of various steroidogenic enzymes in the lesions, of which HSD3B2 showed constantly high expression, whereas CYP11A1 expression was low.
DR5	purpura	Type III groups together 10 autoimmune diseases (autoimmune thyroid disease, myasthenia and/or thymoma, Sjoegren's syndrome, pernicious anaemia, idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura, Addison's disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, vitiligo, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, systemic lupus erythematosus) for which a genetic predisposition (phenotype HLA B8 and/or DR3 or DR5) seems to be an important factor.
DR5	purpura	A significant increase in the frequency of HLA DR5 antigen was observed in patients with ARC mainly in purpura thrombocytopenic patients.
miR-211	breast cancer	Genome-wide pathway analysis with the dysregulated genes after overexpression of either of the two miRs in MCF-7 breast cancer cell identified the "Cancer"- and "Cell signaling"-related pathway as the top pathway for miR-204 and miR-211, respectively.
miR-211	breast cancer	In addition, a high association was observed between miR-204 and miR-211 expression in breast cancer tissue.
miR-211	breast cancer	To shed light on their roles of miR-211 in breast cancer, the expression of miR-211 was examined by real-time RT-PCR in breast cancer and normal tissues.
MiR-211	breast cancer	MiR-211 is significantly downregulated in breast cancer.
MiR-211	breast cancer	MiR-211 re-expression suppressed cell growth, cell cycle, migration, and invasion in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB231.
miR-211	breast cancer	The expression and the functional role of several miRNAs (miR-206, miR-31, miR-27a/b, miR-21, miR-92a, miR-205, miR-125a/b, miR-10b, miR-155, miR-146a/b, miR-335, miR-204, miR-211, miR-7, miR-22, miR-126, and miR-17) in breast cancer has been identified.
miR-211	mammary cancer	Quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed that miR-135b, miR-192, miR-194 and miR-211 were significantly up-regulated in radiation-induced mammary cancer compared with spontaneous cancer and normal mammary tissue.
HBD	rash	The HBD/LD ratio in the measles patients two to three days after the onset of rash was significantly lower than that in control subjects (P less than 0.001).
IL-2	corneal neovascularization	UC treatment obviously reduced the expression levels of IL-2, IFN-Gamma, NF-KBp65, ICAM-1 and VEGF and increased inhibitory kappa B alpha (IKB-Alfa) expression in the grafts, where no obvious inflammatory cell infiltration or corneal neovascularization was found.
CBs	reducing body myopathy	In contrast, none of other patients with MFM had necklace CBs except for one patient with reducing body myopathy.
MMA	neuropathy	Among the serums assessed, MMA levels showed a positive correlation to TNSr and KNPQ in the IPD patients with peripheral neuropathy (TNSr r = 0.882, p &lt; 0.001, KNPQ r = 0.710, p = 0.004), while Vitamin B12 and homocysteine showed no statistically significant correlation.
MMA	neuropathy	The serum MMA positively correlated with the severity of neuropathic pain and this can be used as a useful marker in assessment of peripheral neuropathy in Parkinson's disease.
MMA	neuropathy	Functional vitamin B12 deficiency, defined by elevated levels of the B12-dependent metabolites, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and/or homocysteine, despite normal B12 values, may cause neuropathy and is associated with disorders linked to increased oxidative stress.
GDF-9	chronic cholecystitis	CDC6 and GDF-9 expressions in 108 gallbladder adenocarcinomas, 15 gallbladder polyps, 35 chronic cholecystitis tissues, and 46 peritumoral tissues were detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC).
GDF-9	chronic cholecystitis	We demonstrated that positive CDC6 and GDF-9 expressions were significantly higher in adenocarcinomas than that in peritumoral tissues, polyps, and chronic cholecystitis (p &lt; 0.01).
MFAP4	cirrhosis	Previously, we identified MFAP4 as a serum biomarker candidate for hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in hepatitis C patients.
MFAP4	cirrhosis	The aim of the present study was to elucidate the potential of MFAP4 as biomarker for hepatic fibrosis with a focus on the differentiation of no to moderate (F0-F2) and severe fibrosis stages and cirrhosis (F3 and F4, Desmet-Scheuer scoring system).
MFAP4	cirrhosis	Linear and logistic multivariate regression analyses were performed and nonparametric receiver operating characteristic-curves for cirrhosis were used to estimate cut-off points for pMFAP4.
Microfibrillar-associated protein 4	cirrhosis	Microfibrillar-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) is a systemic biomarker that is significantly elevated in samples from patients suffering from hepatic cirrhosis.
MFAP-4	cirrhosis	Tropomyosin and MFAP-4 demonstrated high serum levels in patients with hepatic cirrhosis of different causes.
MFAP-4	cirrhosis	A quantitative analysis of MFAP-4 serum levels in a large number of patients showed MFAP-4 as novel candidate biomarker with high diagnostic accuracy for prediction of nondiseased liver versus cirrhosis [area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.97, P &lt; 0.0001] as well as stage 0 versus stage 4 fibrosis (AUC = 0.84, P &lt; 0.0001), and stages 0 to 3 versus stage 4 fibrosis (AUC = 0.76, P &lt; 0.0001).
PARs	cancer	Low CRF had PARs of 9.3% and 10.5% for cancer mortality in subjects who had overweight and obesity, respectively.
PARs	cancer	The population attributable risks (PARs) were 0.41, 0.40 and 0.38 for total, CVD and cancer mortality, accordingly.
EARs	lung cancer	Mean EARs for lung cancer were 17.5 cases per 10,000 persons per year (PY) and 10.1 PY.
EARs	breast cancer	Mean EARs for breast cancer were 8.2 PY and 2.8 PY.
PARs	cancer	In addition, through activation of G-protein-coupled protease activated receptors (PARs) TF induces cell signaling that is related to cancer, angiogenesis and inflammation.
PARs	cancer	PARs are implicated in a wide range of diseases, such as cancer and inflammation.
PARs	cancer	Thrombin-induced activation of protease-activated receptors (PARs) represents a link between inflammation and cancer.
AQP1	hydrocele	Frozen tunica vaginalis specimens from patients with adult-onset primary hydrocele testis and control male nonhydrocele patients were subjected to Western blot analysis for the detection of AQP1 and AQP3 proteins.
AQP1	hydrocele	AQP1 protein expression in the tunica vaginalis was significantly higher in patients with adult-onset hydrocele testis than in the controls.
AQP1	hydrocele	The densities of AQP1-expressing capillaries and lymphatic vessels were similar between the tunica vaginalis of the controls and those of hydrocele patients.
AQP1	hydrocele	In conclusion, overexpression of the AQP1 protein in individual capillary endothelial cells of the tunica vaginalis may contribute to the development of adult-onset primary noncommunicating hydrocele testis as another aquaporin-related disease.
situs inversus totalis	abdominal aortic aneurysm	There are very few reports in the published literature of abdominal aortic aneurysm in patient with situs inversus totalis, all of whom underwent open aneurysm repair.
situs inversus totalis	abdominal aortic aneurysm	The authors describe a case of successfully repaired abdominal aortic aneurysm with a false aneurysm of the right external iliac artery in situs inversus totalis.
situs inversus totalis	abdominal aortic aneurysm	The surgical management of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm in situs inversus totalis is discussed.
CD103	MLNs	Collectively, the MLN CD11b- CD103+ PD-L1High DC subset probably takes up luminal antigens in the intestine, migrates to MLNs, and highly induces regulatory T cells through TGF-Beta activation.
CD103	MLNs	Furthermore, Ye were found exclusively associated with CD103(+) DCs in the MLNs from wild-type mice, but not from CCR7(-/-) mice, demonstrating a CCR7 dependent transport of Ye by CD103(+) DCs from LP to the MLNs.
CD103	MLNs	Although extensive studies have demonstrated the importance of the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and intestinal CD103(+) dendritic cells (DCs) in driving small intestinal tolerance to protein antigen, the structural and immunological basis of colonic tolerance remain poorly understood.
CD103	MLNs	Despite tolerance development, CD103(+)CD11b(+) DCs, which are the major migratory DC population in the MLNs, and the tolerance-related retinoic acid-generating enzyme RALDH2 were virtually absent from the ILNs.
CD103	mLNs	Here, we demonstrate that GVHD markedly enhances alloantigen presentation within the mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs), mediated by donor CD103(+)CD11b(-) dendritic cells (DCs) that migrate from the colon under the influence of CCR7.
CD103	MLNs	CD103(+) dendritic cells (DCs) continuously migrate from the intestine to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and maintain tolerance by driving the development of regulatory T cells (Treg) in the gut.
CD103	MLNs	Treatment with PBS followed by 1 single dose of VSL#3, 18 h before killing, was associated with a 2-fold increase in CD103(+)CD11c(+) dendritic cells in MLNs and PPs.
CD103	MLNs	Reduced numbers of Th17 cells, suppressed interleukin (IL)-6 production by intestinal explants, and increased Tregs and CD103-positive regulatory dendritic cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were observed.
CD103	MLNs	Thus, oral administration of C. kefyr ameliorated EAE by altering the microflora, accompanied by increased Tregs and CD103-positive regulatory dendritic cells in MLNs and decreased Th17 cells in the intestinal lamina propria.
CD103	MLNs	The proportion of CD103 DCs in PPs and MLNs and IL-10-expressing CD4 T cells of PPs and the LP increased after indomethacin treatment.
CD103	MLNs	The PP-null mice showed greater indomethacin-induced enteropathy, fewer CD103 DCs in their MLNs, and lower proportion of IL-10-expressing CD4 T cells of their LP than WT mice, regardless of commensal bacteria.
CD103	MLNs	Naive splenic CD4 T cells co-cultured with CD103 DCs isolated from the MLNs of indomethacin-injected WT mice produced a higher amount of IL-10 compared with those co-cultured with CD103 DCs.
PTHrP	rickets	In rickets, on the other hand, no PTH/PTHrP receptor gene expression was observed in the growth plate from day 8 of a vitamin D-deficient diet.
PTHrP	rickets	These results suggest that alterations in the PTH/PTHrP receptor gene expression are associated with rickets but not with TD.
PTHrP	rickets	The reduction in the PTH/PTHrP receptor gene expression in rickets may be due to the high plasma levels of PTH.
Cav1.3	atrial fibrillation	What is more important is that the depressed-expression of Cav1.3 paralleled with enhanced-expression of Snapin was documented in atrial samples from atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.
Cav1.3	atrial fibrillation	Furthermore, inactivation of Cav1.3 channels promotes also atrial fibrillation and flutter in knockout mice suggesting that these channels can play a role in stabilizing atrial rhythm.
Cav1.3	atrial fibrillation	The significance of the tissue-specific expression of the channel is underpinned by our previous demonstration of atrial fibrillation in a Cav1.3 null mutant mouse model.
MRI 1	schizophrenia	MRS studies (MRI 1.5 T unit) were performed in 49 patients with schizophrenia (30 with auditory hallucinations and 19 without auditory hallucinations) and 37 controls.
OPN	retinal degeneration	As a first step towards understanding the role of OPN in retinal degeneration (RD), we examined changes in OPN expression in a mouse model of RD induced by exposure to a blue light-emitting diode (LED).
osteopontin	retinal disease	Similarly, those who had retinal disease had higher osteopontin concentrations than those without (16.8+/-2 vs. 12.4+/-3 mg/L; p=0.005).
osteopontin	proliferative diabetic retinopathy	We investigated the expression of S100A4 and correlated it with clinical disease activity as well as with the levels of osteopontin (OPN), soluble syndecan-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).
ENAH	cancer	Recent studies show overexpressed ENAH in several cancer types, and ENAH correlates with tumor invasiveness.
ENAH	gastric adenocarcinoma	This study aimed to investigate the expression and function of ENAH in primary gastric adenocarcinoma, and its prognostic significance.
ENAH	cancer	We found significantly increased mRNA (P = 0.0283) and protein (P = 0.0301) expression of ENAH in gastric cancer tissues.
