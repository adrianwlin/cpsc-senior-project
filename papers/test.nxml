Vertebrate <italic>LIPA</italic> genes contained nine coding exons, while all vertebrate <italic>CH25H</italic> genes were without introns. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the distinct nature of the vertebrate <italic>LIPA</italic> gene and protein family in comparison with other vertebrate acid lipases and has apparently evolved from an ancestral <italic>LIPA</italic> gene which predated the appearance of vertebrates.</p>
