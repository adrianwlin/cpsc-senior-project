This is the text I wanted to find. LIPA and CH25H genes were located in tandem on all vertebrate genomes examined and showed several predicted transcription factor binding sites and CpG islands located within the 5&#x02032; regions of the human genes. Vertebrate LIPA genes contained nine coding exons, while all vertebrate CH25H genes were without introns. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the distinct nature of the vertebrate LIPA gene and protein family in comparison with other vertebrate acid lipases and has apparently evolved from an ancestral LIPA gene which predated the appearance of vertebrates.
